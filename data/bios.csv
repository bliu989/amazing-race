Aaron & Arianne,"
“”

BioQ & A
Aaron and Arianne have been friends for over 15 years after meeting at the Florida Academy of Dramatic Arts. Aaron thought ""she was stuck up, a show off and developed a huge crush on her that he want to crush her.""
They are the worst of friends and have traveled through life together: ""it's been like a steel coaster--scary."" They have shared many wonderful memories together and hard times as well. The only problem with being more than just friends is that Aaron is gay and Arianne is straight. As Arianne says, her biggest disappointment with Aaron is that ""they planned to be together some day they will not be naturally conceived.""
They both look at this experience as an opportunity to travel the world with their best friend. Aaron describes himself as passionate, loyal and carefree, while Arianne describes herself as emotional, exotic and down to earth. They feel that they will win because of their physical abilities, agility, urban sensibility and, of course, their sense of humor.
The agree that the most important items in their backpacks are their iPod and wristbands, because as they say ""music inspires us and our style inspires others."" Aaron and Arianne are fluent in both body language and the international language of love.

Aaron received his B.F.A. from New York University and is now a pre-school teacher in New York. His birth date is November 12. Arianne attended Northwestern University and received her B.S. in speech. Her birth date is February 3.[1]


 I've done a lot of domestic and a little international traveling. It's all been a positive experience. I love to see new things, meet new people, and especially, eat new foods. I'm looking forward to seeing more.
 I've had some good times in a small handful of countries. It's high time to cover the rest of the world.


 The actual act of traveling. Airports have a tendency to stress me out, so does waiting in lines, large crowds and cramped spaces.
 Obtaining airline tickets, long lines and misplacing my passport.


 Our iPod & our wristbands. Music and style are integral parts of our lives, both individually and as a Team.
 We have an iPod, wristbands and pretty Persian scarves. This is very important, because music inspires us, and our style inspires others.


 The chance to check out of my day-to-day life and have the adventure of a lifetime with my best friend. Also, more and more, the money seems to be appealing.
 I have nothing better to do than take a free trip around the world and win a million dollars.


 Yes. Domestic and short-term, but always a blast.
 We have traveled through life together. It's been like a roller coaster: scary, thrilling and so much fun.


 Eating live insects and being in deep ocean waters.
 I'm afraid of eating live bugs and the chance my parachute won't open.


 I'm very focused. When I set my mind on something, it gets done. I can usually get what I want and I can multi-task with the best of them. My directness in getting things accomplished can sometimes be off-putting to others. I get so focused that I have a tendency not to recognize how I affect others. When task-mastering, I have no patience.
 My strengths tend to be Aaron's weaknesses and vice versa. I tend to be more laid back and tolerant of the status quo, whereas Aaron brings a certain clear-minded focus. These traits can be strengths or weaknesses depending on the situation. We really complement each other in that way. We're both in the best shape of our lives and have a fierce endurance. We're agile and able to learn and adapt to awkward physical challenges. Our urban sensibility makes us well-suited to handle new cultures, and our sense of humor makes our weaknesses a little less weak and a lot more funny.


 Arianne is compassionate, capable, determined and sexy. Her physical strength blended with her inner and outer beauty, sprinkled with her urban savvy, survival instincts and sense of humor, is a recipe for success. Her only weakness in relation to the Race might be her judgment with people. She wants to believe in everyone.
 See my answer to the previous question.


 My cats, Siena and Sydney, first. But coming in a close second is my shower and all its gorgeous products.
 I will miss my cat, Ming. I'll also miss my phone.


 The international language of love.
 I speak body language fluently.


 I'd love to do some extensive European traveling, especially in the Mediterranean.
 I have this Tokyo itch. I really want to check out Japan.


 Aside from language barriers, I feel confident that I'm prepared for anything or anyplace.
 I lived in the U.K. for a semester during college. I know London pretty well and have visited Scotland and Wales. And the locals seem to have a real grasp of the English language.[2]

 Dance Instructor/Choreographer
 I technically train competitive students which includes tap, jazz, turning/jumping and condition classes. I also choreograph dance routines and design costumes/props for competitive dance groups and soloists on a regional/national level.
 Dance, design and exercise.
 Creative, athletic and thoughtful.
 I am most proud of the training and growth that I have provided for the past eight years at my dance studio as well as the accomplishments that I have helped my students to achieve. It is so rewarding to see students achieve their goals and grow as dancers and human beings.
 Katniss
 Hugh Jackman for his stellar good looks (not for the song and dance talent, though.)
 Getting lost and not having the ability to communicate.
 I hate how generic this is, but it is true… Exploring new places that I have never been to before.
 I would have to say it's a tie between learning to communicate and not piss each other off at the same time. We can be juvenile and sarcastic with one another. The other would be our battle for control/power between over each other. We are both Type ""A"" and can be bull-headed.
 He's addicted to his phone and can't disconnect easily. Also, his impulsivity can cause problems.
 I would love to visit Paris, France and go back to the 1920s. Can we make that happen? Last time I went I was 21 and broke. I could barely afford a baguette. I'm hoping this time will be a step up from that.
 I'm hoping to gain some clarity on what I mean to Ryan. I feel lately that our relationship has become a rollercoaster. The highs are high but the lows are low. I am trying to be patient, but I know what I want and right now he can't give that to me.

 When we fight I spit venom and don't tend to converse like a normal human being.
 She is over analytical, doesn't compromise and plays the victim.
 Thailand – It looks beautiful and is close to other counties. I hate traveling to just one place; I'd prefer to have access to nearby countries.
 I hope to gain clarity about this relationship. Can it work at a time when I want to be boyfriend/girlfriend and she wants something more?

 I've always wanted to go to Madagascar because it seems remote and adventurous. Peru, to surf and Machu Picchu. Also, Israel because it's a bible land.

"
Adam & Rebecca,"


BioBefore the Race
Adam & Rebecca are an ex-couple that met at a spinning class. Rebecca's first impression of Adam was that he was gay, but after he pursued her for months, he proved otherwise. Both of them are spinning teachers/personal trainers.
Both say that they share similar sensibilities, are very competitive and are both interested in fitness, but are different in every other way. She is social, he isn't. She's outgoing, he's not. He is practical and prefers routine, while she is spontaneous.

Rebecca says she's doing the Race because she could use the cash, but Adam says his main motivation for doing THE AMAZING RACE is that after years of sitting on his couch watching the Race and saying, ""I can do that,"" he wants to prove that he really can.[1]


 My previous travel experience is limited at best. For me, going from the [San Fernando] Valley to Santa Monica is quite the trek. I consider a long trip sitting in the car for more than 45 minutes.
 Vast. I am very restless and have trouble staying put. I studied in London for six months and often missed class because I was always traveling.


 I do not know what the most stressful aspect of traveling is. I really do not even know what ""traveling"" is like. Good luck to me.
 I hate flying. But with today's advances in prescription drugs, I'm dealing with this.


 I wanted to be on THE AMAZING RACE because it is my favorite TV show. Every week, I sit and watch and think to myself, ""These people are crazy. I'm crazy. I could do this."" Also, I thought I needed a vacation. Again, good luck to me.
 Traveling the world for free sounds really good to me!


 Rebecca and I have traveled together in the past. I went on a cruise to the Caribbean with her and her family and hung out at their home in Virginia Beach for a couple of weeks. It was one of the best times I have ever had in my life.
 Adam came with my family on a cruise in the Caribbean and then we spent some time together in my hometown, Virginia Beach. We had our usual daily arguments over trivial things, but overall we had a great time!


 My biggest fear concerning the competition is possibly having to bungee jump. The thought has been leaving me sleepless.
 My biggest fear is that Adam and I will kill each other and will not be able to finish the Race because we will be dead.


 I am not the bravest person on the planet. I do not like heights, bugs, weird food, heat, extreme cold or anything else outside my routine. On the other hand, I am relentless, motivating, strong, smart and competitive.
 I have strong communicative skills and can easily adapt. My weakness is that I'm very impatient, mostly with Adam. I have no sense of direction and cannot read a map to save my life.


 Rebecca might just be the bravest person on the planet. She is not scared of anything (even if she is, she will try it anyway) and hates routine. Rebecca does not possess the gift of patience, which she will need in dealing with me.
 Adam is very competitive and passionate about everything he does. He will give 100 percent and never give up. He can be verbally abusive to me, and has trouble being social. He often isn't the friendliest, and I'm afraid that will hinder us from forming potential alliances.


 I will miss my dog Bailey the most. A close second is my spinning class. I never miss it. Hi Spinners.
 Other than my friends and family, I have no attachments, except maybe my spicy tuna rolls and my spinning classes.


Adam: I speak English, though some would question that statement. Also, yo hablo Espanol, un poco.
Rebecca: A little Hebrew, but somehow I don't think that will come in very handy on this Race.


Adam: I am hoping that the Race takes us to Argentina, as my grandparents are from there. I have always wanted to visit.
Rebecca: I really want to go to Africa and Asia.


 I feel best prepared to go where the weather is a balmy 78 degrees all the time and the protein bars flow like water from every corner store. Hmmmm, sounds like home.
 England: no language barrier, and I've spent a lot of time there.[2]
"
Aiello Family,"
When Tony Aiello first met the men who would eventually capture the hearts of his three beloved daughters, he never thought he'd end up racing around the world with them. ""Forget about it,"" he'd quip.
Compelled by a gnawing curiosity about how his three sons-in-law would handle such a competition, Tony, leads the unlikely foursome from Mansfield, Massachusetts, for their first official trip without their wives by their side.
Tony, 57, is the leader in both age and experience. He works as a restaurant consultant and describes himself as protective and competitive. Even though his favorite movie of all time is the ""Godfather,"" his tough exterior melts away when it comes to his daughters, who he says are his greatest accomplishment.
Kevin, 31, is married to one of Tony's twin daughters. His successful career in public relations for a high-tech company has honed his diplomatic skills. The father of two is a self-described risk-taker with a love for travel and adventure.
Matt, also 31, works as corporate project manager and is known for his fearlessness and sense of humor. Matt, married to Tony's other twin daughter, is a father of two as well.
David, 26, is the youngest on the team, but the most well-trained. His career as a police officer in Rhode Island is preceded by eight years as an infantryman in the U.S. Marine Corps. He's married to Tony's youngest daughter.
The Race will surely show these in-laws the different sides to each other as they are forced to bond outside the familiar comfort of their family circle.[1]
"
Aja & Ty,"
This long-distance couple is looking for an opportunity to be together for an extended period of time. They've been dating long distance for nine months, living in two separate states and the longest time they've spent together was last Christmas for two weeks. They feel that the Race will help them determine if they can truly handle living together on a daily basis.
Having met each other four years ago at the University of Michigan, they quickly became friends, although Aja was dating someone else. When things turned sour, Aja realized Ty was the one for her – the only problem was she was living in Los Angeles and Ty was in Detroit.
Aja is an aspiring actress who also works as a makeup artist. She describes herself as energetic, insightful and compassionate. When asked what her biggest pet peeve about her teammate was, Aja said that Ty is known to have a poor estimation of time.
Ty is no stranger to the gym and he describes himself as ultra-competitive and hates the thought of losing. Currently, he works as a banker out of Detroit. He has not had the opportunity to travel much outside of the United States and looks forward to the Race as a chance to explore other cultures and compete against the game's best. He hopes they are as hungry to win as he is. Ty believes that Aja's biggest weakness is she is easily upset.[1]

Alexandra & Sheridan,"[1]

 Chicago, IL

 It's either communication or reading the clue. I think it's reading the clue. Or it could be navigation. Actually a couple of skills. [Laughs.]
 Reading the clue and just taking pause to formulate your strategy. Not just rushing to do things.

 [Laughs.] I've thought of a few.
 Natalie and Nadiya! [Laughs.] No, no, no.
 [Pause.] I mean, Eswar and Aparna, on paper, are kind of similar. They're engineer siblings. I just don't know.
 What about Hung and Chee?
 We kind of think about Hung and Chee. They were a couple; we're siblings. Kind of similar way of thinking logical. I think their dynamic is sort of similar.
 I like the Holderness family. I thought the two of them were good.
 And they won. [Laughs.]
 Also won! That wouldn't be bad, too. They were just sort of smart about everything.
 Not cocky, held their cool.
 They kept calm. They sort of kept a level head.
 We used their packing list. [Laughs.]
 [Laughs.] They had some tips.

 Well, I think Sheridan is probably a lot better at staying more calm in a kind of frantic situation, which is important for the race. And I will try to use some of that energy.
 I think Alexandra has a higher tolerance for things. Higher tolerance for low sleep, for running more and pushing herself more. So probably that, to be honest.
 That's fair.

Alison & Donny,"


BioBefore the Race
Alison & Donny are from Pennsylvania and have been dating on and off for three years. The two of them met as students at an athletic convention at the University of Pittsburgh, and then ran into each other at a bar a few weeks later. As Alison puts it, ""He's been hooked ever since."" Alison was runner-up on the CBS summer reality series, BIG BROTHER 4, where her relationship with Donny was often discussed, although he was not in the house with her.
Alison says that although she and Donny have hurt each other in the past, she loves him with all her heart and wouldn't ever want to hurt him again. She describes him as much calmer than herself, and she loves to be the center of attention, while he likes to just watch from the sidelines.
Donny is the first person in his family to graduate from college. He describes himself and Alison as ""both good looking, outgoing and extremely competitive."" He says his most exciting moment in his life was scoring a touchdown in front of 30,000 people.

Alison & Donny describe themselves as ""the greatest example of new age young adults. We give 110% to everything we do and don't accept not getting our way."" They are excited about competing in THE AMAZING RACE 5, as Alison says, ""to see if we should really try to work out our differences from BIG BROTHER. The $1 million is secondary.""[1] 

 Donny and I were both at a University of Pittsburgh Athletic Convention. When he was introduced, I thought he was absolutely gorgeous, so I remembered his name. About two weeks later, I sought him out and introduced myself. We hit it off immediately, but he was a little too persistent, so I didn't talk to him for a year. The following year, I was walking my dog in my new neighborhood at school, and Donny was sitting on the front stoop of his house, which was two doors down from mine. We exchanged phone numbers, and have basically been together ever since.

 Only the strongest survive. Donny and I didn't have the best relationship ever, but now we are better, stronger and more in love than ever.

 We went to Canada and to Mississippi to see his relatives.

 Donny's the strongest, quickest guy I know, and I wouldn't want to be away from him again on another reality show. We figured reality TV tried to rip us apart; the least they could do is throw us together.

 We decided that we are going in as a couple, and we are leaving as a couple. We also try to tell ourselves that we need to push each other and take all the mushy, lovey-dovey stuff out and just COMPETE together.

 I'm soooo impatient, but I'm quick, and I'm usually on top of the game.


 Donny is the strongest person I know. If he can put up with me, he can put up with the world. He does tend to jump the gun and not think things through. And sometimes he's a little lazy, but I love him for it![2]

 Vivacious, creative and driven.
 Playing beach volleyball, running around with my dogs and exploring new areas without a plan.
 Graduating from CSULB with honors while working hard to support myself. I went from living in the small community of Turlock, CA to pursuing my childhood dreams in Southern California. I worked hard, stayed focused and I'm very proud of the choices I made.

 Ashley is a mixture of Jenna Marbles (same look and witty personality) and Victoria Beckham. Ashley has more clothes and heels than any other girl I know. She's a bit of a fashionista!
 Getting sick.
 The opportunity to submerge myself into lifestyles of other cultures! Learning about other cultures has always been a fascination of mine.
 We work really well together so I can't think of anything.
 Ashley takes up too much space when getting ready at the Staples Center. She likes to spread all of her stuff out on the counter. Pretty sure she has at least three of my make-up brushes.
 Paris, because I have always dreamed of standing beside the Eiffel Tower! I have an Eiffel Tower necklace that I love to wear, and I have several Paris themed pieces in my home. Would be a dream come true!

 Ally is a people pleaser. She has to always make sure everyone is happy and if people are not happy, Ally isn't, which can be kind of scary.
 I haven't done any traveling outside of the country so I would love to travel everywhere! New Zealand would be my ultimate travel spot. Every picture looks like a dream.

BioQ & A
Twenty-five-year-old Amanda is a medical technician at a hospital in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. She loves to read and listen to music. Amanda describes herself as ""very emotional, helpful and compassionate."" She comes across as sweet and innocent, but underneath she is a tough, foul-mouthed girl. While Chris tends to be negative, she tends to be positive: good cop, bad cop. Her phobias include spiders, elevators and fear of the dark. Amanda has never traveled outside the United States, but is very excited about the prospect of experiencing new countries and cultures.

Chris is 28 years old and works as a freelance graphic designer in Sioux Falls. He is very self-deprecating in his humor, calling himself ""abominable, cantankerous and obnoxious."" He admits that traveling takes him out of the comfort zone and causes some nervousness. He also has a fear of heights and is leery of flying. He's a perfectionist and tends to be overly critical. During the Race, he plans not only to make fun of the other contestants, but he will also ""scheme, betray, plot and backstab more than any other contestant."" At the same time, Chris says, Amanda will make peace with the other contestants so as not to upset too many people.[1]


 I've gone on some family vacations in the United States and on a few trips with my boyfriend also in the US, but that is the extent of it. I have never been out of this country, not even to Canada or Mexico.
 I have traveled to many places within the US and to Canada and Mexico. I've never left North America and that sucks, so this is a great opportunity to change all that.


 I think the most stressful part of traveling is trying to accomplish everything that you have planned, and if you have not planned squat, it is hard to come up with last minute things to do.
 Traveling. Whether it be plane, train, cargo ship, hang glider, donkey or whatever, the most stressful part is getting from point A to point B. After that it's just gravy. Mmmmm, gravy!


 Toilet paper is the most important item in my backpack so that I can wipe my ass in countries that do not have any.
 My ""camp towel."" It soaks up 10 times its weight. When you're really moist, you want something to be able to sop it up. And what's better than a towel that collects 1000% of its weight in fluid. Right?


 I wanted to be on THE AMAZING RACE to prove to myself, my family, and my boyfriend that I am strong mentally, emotionally and physically. I tend to let people make decisions for me, and this is a big step towards being independent and being able to do things for myself and for my Team.
 To win it. Making friends, seeing great places, being on TV…that's all overrated. I want a ½ million dollars and the right to say, ""I kicked your ass"" to 22 other people.


 Chris and I have taken some vacations here in the US, and we have had so much fun traveling. We seem to really get along well in stressful times, which comes in handy when we're on the road far from home.
 We have traveled, but only to lame places like Wisconsin, Texas and so on. While we usually hate each other in our daily lives, we get along very well when traveling. It's really quite odd. I guess going to another place lets us pretend we're someone else for a while.


 I fear being out of my comfort zone. I like my days to be planned out, however boring that may be. I have a set time to do everything. On the Race, I won't know when I'll eat next, when I'll sleep next, when I'll be able to go to the bathroom next. I'm also afraid to let my partner down.
 Finding out that the next place we'll be going is a country that's just a tad bit ""shady."" Ya know, like North Korea, or Pakistan, or Yemen, or Canada. Those Canadians, they just always seem to look at you funny. Something just isn't right with them. I think they're up to something.


 I am a very positive, up-beat person. I love meeting people, and I am very social, and I like to help others. I'll be able to talk to locals, negotiate with other Teams, and get help when needed. My weaknesses play off that. I have a hard time competing because I care a lot for other people, and I don't want to make them feel bad.
 I don't have too many strengths. I'm more of a liability kind of guy, but if I had to pick, I'd say my strength is my competitiveness. I supply the drive to keep us going. There are far too many weaknesses to list; my primary fault is I'm an asshole.


 He is very logical and rational and a wonderful decision-maker. He is very methodical in everything that he does, and he weighs all the pros and cons before acting upon anything. Instead of acting quickly in stressful times, he still enforces reason. His one big weakness is that he is super critical about everything, especially himself. He is his own worst enemy, and he has to evaluate everything he does or says. Sometimes he makes too negative of judgments and gives himself too hard of a time when it's not necessary.
 Her strength is her sweetness. But don't let the candy coating fool you. Underneath it, is a somewhat of an evil little woman. And that also is a part of her strength. She can act all innocent and sweet and then the next minute she is cussing like a truck driver and flipping people off in traffic. Her weakness is her ability to quit almost anything at a moment's notice. She gives up way too easily. And that is a big thing on this Race.


 I am afraid of the dark, so in our house we have various nightlights positioned throughout, so needless to say I will miss my nightlights. I know that I am going to be exhausted while traveling, hopefully that will defeat my night time worries.
 My worn-out, old, green rocking chair. It's great to just chill out in and think about stuff. And that is something that I'll be forced to live without for a while: relaxation.


 I speak English. I learned some French in college, and at that time I could read and write it fairly well and sometimes even engage in conversation. I could probably ask some decent questions, but I do not think I would understand people's responses. I'm pretty good at reading body language.
 I speak English fairly well. Un poquito Espanol (a little Spanish). Lsoay, omesay Igpay Atlay (Also, some Pig Latin).


 I love animals, so really anywhere with a lot of wildlife around me is cool. Other than that, I cannot wait to see anything and everything this Race has to offer. Bring it on!
 The Pyramids in Egypt.


 Um…well…the United States. Does everyone say that? Wish me luck, please.

 Amanda (Student); Kris (Sales Representative)
 Dating
This young couple who met more than three years ago hopes to spend the rest of their lives together, but before taking their relationship to the next level they are looking forward to sharing this experience together. Their favorite shared memory is falling in love with each other over bonfires at the beach accompanied by wine and s'mores. They plan on creating many more memories together on the Race and are hoping to fall in love all over again. 
Amanda is a communications student at Cal State San Marcos, but is working at a tanning salon until she graduates. She describes herself as outgoing, talkative and generous. When asked what her biggest pet peeve about her teammate is Amanda says that Kris occasionally doesn't seem interested when she is talking to him. 
Kris, who was once almost attacked by a bear in Alaska, enjoys hunting, fishing and snow boarding. He currently works as a sales representative for a communications company. He has not had the opportunity to travel much outside of the United States and looks forward to the Race as a chance to explore other cultures and compete against the game's best. He hopes the other Teams are as hungry to win as he is. 

Amanda and Kris both have a tendency to be stubborn when it comes to a disagreement, but they realize they must be more open to ideas and solutions from one another in order to propel their team into winning the one million dollars. They feel this is a perfect opportunity to work on their shortcomings and any other communication issues they have. Amanda and Kris have so much in common that they complete each others sentences. One shared characteristic is the ability to make friends wherever they go, which can come in handy when racing around the globe.[1]

 Season 14/8th place
 We were naive and trusted too many other teams. We forgot that we were racing for one million dollars.
 The cheese hill! The task to carry cheese down the hill in Switzerland that was covered in animal poop was one of the most challenging tasks. It was funny watching it on TV and seeing how funny we all looked. The hill was far steeper than it looked on TV.
 Switzerland! It was the most beautiful place I have ever seen.
 Kris and I want a second chance. We were doing so well until the woodpile in Krasnoyarsk, Russia. We fell behind and then were u-turned, which we were unable to recover from.
 Our relationship has grown stronger since the last Race. We proved not only to ourselves, but to the world that we balance each other out and make for a great team.
 My fiance, my family, my pets and my friends.
 As soon as I graduated from college, I moved in with Kris in Pismo Beach and I missed my graduation ceremony.
 It might sound funny since Kris and I both have a B.A. in Communications, but we tend to struggle with communicating with one another in tense situations.
 I hope to travel to as many different places as possible and see the world with my new fiance.
 Sometimes he second guesses my judgment. He needs to remember we are both natural leaders and I have much to bring to the table as well.
 Purchase our first house together and I am sure some of the money would also go towards our wedding.
 Not trusting anyone, yet willing to make ""alliances"" to get ahead.

 Amanda and I are social people and last time around we put too much trust in teams we thought were friends. This is a Race for one million dollars and this time around, we are not going to hold back for anything.
 It is hard to pick just one, but if I have to, I would say when I got to drive on the Autobahn in Germany. That was definitely on my bucket list.
 Probably Switzerland. All the old architecture and cobble stone streets seemed like something out of a book.
 Since we got u-turned in Siberia and eliminated as a result of not being able to recover from it, I constantly think about what would have happened and how far we would have gone if we weren't u-turned. I know we can win this!
 I am now engaged!
 I had a hard time finding a job in San Diego after getting back from our first time on the Race. I ended up taking a job offer in central California and leaving behind all my friends and family. It was a hard move to make to say the least.
 We are both strong-minded, natural leaders and both like to be in control. This time around I need to not second guess things she says as much and hand over the reigns.
 I want to experience new cultures and places with the one person that means more to me than anything to me.
 Amanda doesn't like to be wrong and sometimes it is very hard to get through to her.
 I would put some of it towards a house, some for our wedding and invest whatever is left over.

 I will not trust a soul, but try to be very discrete about it. This time around, I want to fly under the radar to not put targets on our backs, but at the same time, do whatever it takes to get ahead. We are not going to hold back for anything or anyone.[2]

 I can't decide if he has selective or bad hearing. I hope he hears what I am saying.
 His sound effects while I'm driving.  He'll say ""uurrpp"" when he wants me to break, ""bammm"" (as he hits the dash or window) if he thinks I could have hit something or ""you see that car?"" I'll be like, ""the one right in front of me?""
 Italy, because I love Tuscan architecture, the waterways, buildings, food, vineyards... It's beautiful. I'd also like to go to Africa – an African Safari. I'd love to photograph and experience nature at its simplest and most beautiful.
 An experience of a lifetime and time with my husband. Our marriage has been an amazing race – a honeymoon baby (although we intended to wait) set us on the go mark! We are very family oriented so, between the kids and his 14 year NFL career, he and I only get to steal moments for each other. It will be good to just enjoy each other.

 Snowboarding, road trips with Daniel and camping with friends.
 Motivated, fun and adventurous.
 Learning to walk again comfortably!! It was not an easy feat but now I don't think twice. Everything else is just a bonus!
 Amelia Earhart because she was strong, adventurous and took risks.
 Daniel has had random people confuse him with pro FMX race Todd Potter. I think he looks like him too but Daniel's cuter. Really, Daniel has a heart and personality all his own.
 Being so far away from home and something happens to me or a family member and we can't reach each other in time.
 Seeing all the world has to offer, experiencing other cultures and having stories to tell!
 Communication is our biggest challenge at times. If we argue, sometimes it can be about how we are arguing instead of the actual problem.
 He likes to walk around the house wearing one sock on his foot and one sock off! I don't know why he does it but he seems to love it and it always makes me laugh.
 There are so many! Japan, Nepal, Austria. All have amazing cultures and I would love to snowboard in Japan!
 Our work with our organization can take over at times. I think The Race will give us the opportunity for just the two of us to work together outside of the organization and it may even give us the opportunity to communicate and support each other better!

 I am a Ph.D. student in food science studying polyol (sugar-free sweetener) crystallization in confectionery products.
 Logical, sarcastic and curious.
 Exploring new restaurants, food science, running and volleyball.
 I had an ""experiment gone wrong"" incident during one of my internships that surprisingly turned into something really interesting that the company wanted to pursue further. It was one of those moments that made me realize why I love science.
 Leonard from ""The Big Bang Theory"" (obviously a female version and into food science, not physics).
 Kerry Washington.
 Getting lost. I don't always have the best sense of direction (don't tell Maya!).
 Seeing the rest of the world. I really have not done much international travel and cannot wait to see what else is out there and try all of the delicious foods!
 We will have to rely on each other in ways that we haven't before. Our most important responsibilities (research) are independent from each other; this will not be the case on the Race!
 She can be SO picky. She yells at me when I drink coffee or open the refrigerator in our office. She says that the smells bother her which is ridiculous. It's like living with a crazy person.
 The Galapagos Islands. There are so many unique landforms, animals and plants. Plus, it is a tropical place with gorgeous beaches and a rich scientific history.
 I want to prove to myself and the world that scientists are more than beakers and lab coats. I also hope to grow our relationship outside of lab, most of what we do centers around food science and our research.

 Traveling, exploring new cultures, meeting new people, anything involving ice cream and working out/running!
 Discovering my passion in life (anything involving ice cream) and being able to do what I love and love what I do every day. It's a beautiful thing.
 Kerry Washington (Olivia Pope) gets down to business and commands a room with ease. Great sense of style, knows how to have fun, intuitive, graceful and self-confident.
 Mayim Bialik, both on and off of ""The Big Bang Theory."" Number one, Mayim (yes, we are on a first name basis) and Amy resemble each other and have many similar mannerisms and personality traits. Both are smart, goofy, curious, intelligent, driven and knowledgeable of random things.
 Having to get one too many shots. I believe pain is weakness leaving the body but shots just don't do it for me!
 Being introduced to new cultures, people, experiences and opportunities beyond what I can imagine. I also enjoy learning, growing, building memories and trying new ice creams/frozen desserts!
 The biggest challenge we will face on the Race will most likely be over-thinking situations and challenges. As scientists we have learned to be very analytical.
 Amy talks a lot. So do I, but sometimes she talks at times when we need to focus on the task at hand and/or about something totally unrelated, getting us off task.
 Pretty much any place I have not been! I love to travel and will visit anyplace if given the opportunity to do so!
 I hope to grow our bond outside of the lab. I also hope to show the world that scientists are more than just lab coats, beakers and goggles. Lastly, I hope to inspire others to pursue something they have always wanted to do… that is what the Race is for me!

Andre & Damon,"
“”

BioQ & A
Andre, 32, and Damon, 33, met a decade ago while attending the University of Maryland. When Damon transferred to another university, the two lost touch for several years. Ironically, they were reunited in Los Angeles when they both stopped for the same traffic light.
Both Andre and Damon have jobs that put them in challenging situations. Andre is a police officer and Damon is a firefighter. They're used to dealing with all kinds of people, making quick decisions and working fast. Damon says that he and Andre decided to apply for THE AMAZING RACE for two reasons. First, ""The opportunity to compete in a forum that is challenging physically and mentally."" And second, ""The cash…cha-ching!!!""
Damon says that his greatest asset on the trip is his brain. ""The most important item I am carrying is not in my backpack. It is underneath my hat. I am pretty smart and resourceful,"" he says. Andre feels his strength is his ability to read the other teams and understand the game.
Together, this pair of friends have traveled extensively. While stationed in the military, Damon served in the Marine Corps and Andre was in the United States Air Force. Both are self-confident, physically fit and work incredibly well under pressure. Plus, whenever necessary, Damon can be a manipulative schemer, while Andre is a playful joker. Together, the two are a formidable Team who plan to give their fellow racers a run for the money.

Andre is married and lives in Los Angeles (he is originally from Baltimore, Maryland). Damon, who also lives in Los Angeles, is married with two children.[1]


 My previous travel experience basically limits to what I did while in the military. I have done some stateside (domestic) traveling.
 I have traveled to several places while in the military, i.e. Alaska, Honduras, Vancouver B.C., Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Belgium. However, my leisurely travel has been limited to Nigeria and the Republic of Benin. I have also traveled within the U.S.


 Packing and traveling with luggage.
 The most stressful aspect of traveling is landing at the airport. I read that most accidents have to do with aircraft landing.


 Passport and ID, because without it I am in trouble.
 The most important item I am carrying is not in my backpack. It is underneath my hat: my brain. I am pretty smart resourceful.


 To do something totally out of my element.
 I was looking for a challenge, one that was physically and mentally tough. THE AMAZING RACE looked like a race that requires both of those items and more. Oh, and don't forget that $1 million would buy a lot of golf balls!


 We traveled to New York together. It was fun.
 We traveled to New York from Maryland while in college. It was a three-hour ride. I don't really consider this trip to be travel.


 Not winning.
 The fear of failing is the scariest thing about this whole experience. I fully expect to win; anything less would be hard to deal with.


 Good decision-making skills (strength); too calculating (weakness).
 I bring self-confidence. And I'm at my best under pressure. I work in a pressure-filled environment. For me, this is a natural condition; not to many people can say this. My job deals with life or death for myself and fellow firemen or the safety of citizens.


 He can be a little more direct than me (strength).
 Andre is very self-confident as well; however, he is also analytical and calculating. These characteristics create a balance to my spontaneous and risk-taking traits.


 My wife, whom I've missed since the day I left.
 The item I miss the most is my cell phone. However, I miss my kids, Aisha and Wesley, tremendously.

 Details. Paying attention to details.
 You can be fast all you want to. Because if you're not paying attention, you can be right at the back of the leg of the race. I've seen it too many times where they forgot something, or they didn't read something right, and it cost them the race. Slow and steady wins the race.

 I…don't know. [Laughs.] I like season seven. And I always modeled off of Uchenna and Joyce, because they persevered through a lot of challenges. I like how they push through. And so I said if we ever were faced with that, we'd keep leaning on how they got through it. Especially when she had to shave her head. That was a tough decision.
 Yeah, that was a tough decision.
 For a female to have to go through, and for her to do that, that was strength and perseverance.
 I don't think I would be able to do that, even today. [Laughs.] For females, their hair is like their crown.
 But in terms of learning how they ran the race, the Afghanimals, they like…She loves the Afghanimals.
 I do.
 But I think they're kind of conniving!
 Yeah, they were a little tricky.
 They don't race fair!
 Some parts of it.

 She's very creative and resourceful. As far as work with your hands, creativity always comes out. I am like, as she said, the ""square"" one. So my creative juices…mmm mmm. I have a twin, so my twin took my creative juices. [Laughs.]
 Andrea's very smart. She's very smart and intelligent. And that's where the details come in. That I don't have, and we know that hands down. [Laughs.] We balance each other. I bring that extra ""get outside the box.""
 She's like, ""Let your hair down."" That's what she brings.

Andrew & Dan,"
Life couldn't be any better for these fraternity brothers. Andrew and Dan met while attending Arizona State University and the last four years have been filled with good times. Some of the Teams refer to Andrew and Dan as ""Team Superbad.""
Now they are ready for a life-altering experience. Andrew, a senior, is studying urban planning. He is hoping to make the most of their last year in college before they part ways. His laid-back appearance can be deceiving so count on him to be assertive, hands-on, and ready to take on anything that comes his way.
Dan graduated last December with a degree in Tourism Management. He enjoys bar hopping, sports and all things funny. Dan also loves to travel and hopes to use his extensive global travel knowledge and expertise to get a leg up on the competition.
These two say they can talk their way in or out of anything by cracking jokes and keeping the mood light, and they promise to bring more to the Race than any other Team. Look for them to always keep things entertaining in their own special way.[1]

Anita and Arthur can't wait to make the Race their next big adventure. This energetic couple is open hearted and free spirited. They make and sell their own honey and recently purchased an organic blueberry farm. They have known each other for over 26 years and have been married for almost 14 years. Their blended family and children are the most important part of their lives.
However, don't be fooled by their snowy white hair – they are no strangers to hard work. Living on a farm, they are responsible for maintaining their land, chopping wood and braving the hazardous conditions of beekeeping.
Anita describes herself as optimistic, enthusiastic and compassionate. She is running this Race in hopes of gaining insight to people and places from all corners of the world while traveling side by side with her husband. Her biggest pet peeve about her husband is that he sometimes over-analyzes situations…Anita believes simple can be so much better.
Arthur identifies himself as a problem fixer and hopes to gain a better understanding of himself and his partner. When asked how he and his teammate are most alike—Arthur says that he and his wife share a basic belief in the goodness of people.
This nature-loving couple is still young at heart, and they are ready to experience the world.[1]

This competitive couple is hoping to be engaged by the end of the Race. Back together again after a year-long break-up, Anthony says he will propose to Stephanie if they make it through the Race.
Even though they've overcome many of their differences, their constant bickering would suggest otherwise.
Anthony, a mortgage broker, describes himself as adventurous and entertaining. He enjoys talking sports, hunting and poker. When asked what country he'd most like to visit – Anthony said Italy because he's 100 percent Italian and has yet to visit.
Stephanie is a financial saleswoman. She loves meeting new people and learning different cultures. She describes herself as outgoing, funny and athletic, and loves competition.
Both of them are eager to Race around the world and put their relationship to the test and ultimately prove to everyone – including themselves – that they do belong together.[1]

 Gilbert, Arizona
 Owner of Arizona Goat Yoga (GoatYoga.com).
 As an entrepreneur, I do what is necessary to make Goat Yoga a successful business. On the fun side, I train my 25 goats to jump and interact with hundreds of different people every day for a unique yoga experience. It's like a big circus every time.
 Adventurous, ingenuitive, and motivated!
 I love anything adventurous and outdoors. I was a professional water skier, so I especially enjoy barefoot waterskiing, wakeboarding, and wakesurfing, as well as circus flying trapeze, acrobatics, and stilting. I also like traveling, hiking, rock climbing, mountain biking, rollerblading, snowboarding, and scuba diving.
 I am most proud to be a wife and mother of my three kids. They are pretty great despite my shortcomings. I am also proud of making a very successful business out of playing with my goats, and all the good that has come from it throughout the community.
 My biggest fear would be getting lost in a sketchy area. I don't always have the best sense of direction.
 I love going on adventures, exploring new parts of the world, and seeing new cultures!
 I would love to go Tahiti and hike through glorious waterfalls, swim with massive humpback whales, and scuba dive beautiful coral reefs.
 The Amazing Race has always been a dream of mine, so being able to race is literally a dream come true! I am excited to go to different places, meet new people and soak in the whole experience!!

 I am co-owner of Arizona Goat Yoga, as the Yoga Instructor, and owner of Desert Paddleboards! I teach kids parkour classes and I'm a part-time tour guide.
 Goat Yoga and Desert Paddleboards are companies that encourage people to get out and enjoy life! I make people HAPPY!
 Spontaneous, fun, and a little crazy.
 I love being outdoors doing things like snowboarding, hiking, or wakesurfing at the lake.
 I started my paddleboard business four years ago with two boards and I'm up to 35. Goat Yoga started as a fun idea and now it's an international sensation!
 I used to be worried I wouldn't be able to talk to people but, after going to Europe and China, I realized there's someone everywhere that speaks a little English.
 The best part about traveling is meeting new people. When you have friends around the world, you'll have places to stay around the world.
 Ireland! Ever since I was a little girl and I saw the commercial for 1-800-SHAMROCK, I have wanted to go to Ireland.
 We love having stories to tell at Goat Yoga. The Amazing Race will give us LOTS of stories.

Ari & Staella,"
These fun-loving friends are all about having a good time. They hope that their carefree approach to the Race will result in the $1 million prize.
These Racers met eight years ago and have been best friends ever since. There is rarely a quiet moment when you put them together. Ari works as a server in a restaurant and currently lives with Staella's family.
Ari is catty and not afraid to speak his mind, while Staella won't hesitate to flirt her way to the front of the pack. Staella describes herself as honest, trustworthy and caring. She enjoys working out and dancing. Ari describes himself as mean, rude and hilarious and enjoys dancing and talking trash to people.
Look for these two Racers to possibly ruffle some feathers of their fellow competitors while racing around the world but one thing is for certain, they'll have a blast doing it.[1]

Avi & Joe,"


BioBefore the Race
Avi & Joe were born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. They met 17 years ago in a high school Spanish class. Joe moved to Los Angeles six years ago to expand his advertising business, while Avi is still in Brooklyn and teaching at the same high school where they met.
They are both proud of their similar Jewish upbringings. Joe describes himself as the stereotypical ""New York Jew."" Their similar characteristics are their knowledge and appreciation of the same Yiddish expressions and their love of the Mets.
Joe describes himself as Jerry Seinfeld meets Yoda (with Donald Trump's business flair) and says Avi is George Costanza meets Napoleon. However, Avi sees himself more as Woody Allen and sees Joe as Shaggy from ""Scooby-Doo.""
They both agree that one of their most memorable times together was meeting Avi's childhood idol, Tom Wopat, after a Broadway play. Although the distance between New York and Los Angeles prevents their weekly kibbitz sessions at the local kosher deli, they make up for it by spending many hours talking on the phone.

Their motivation for going on THE AMAZING RACE is to spend quality time together, to challenge themselves and to win the $1 million.[1]


  I have done some travel, mainly with my family: Canada, western and southern US, and I had my bar mitzvah in Israel. In recent years, I have been to England and France to compete in martial arts tournaments and to Alaska so I could experience the wilderness.
  I've seen the vast majority of this country: every region, about 35 states in all (including a New York to California drive). As far as international, I've only hit Europe once, but saw the two coolest cities there (Amsterdam and Belgium). Had a croissant in Charles de Gaulle Airport. Been to west Mexico on a cruise, and was in the Dominican Republic for my honeymoon.


  Making flights on time. Ever since 9/11, it's such a hassle, especially the security. Do I look like a terrorist? Get real.
  I love traveling and find it relaxing. Only stressful things are trying to pack everything to do in whatever time we are there. Crowded airplanes are annoying. Otherwise, I'm such a workaholic and have such a hands-on business that the most stressful thing about being on vacation is forgetting about work or checking my email.


  Looks like it's going to be a fantastic adventure, and we can win it.
  I can't sing, dance or act, but I AM a character. Reality TV is perfect for a guy like me. Besides, I get to travel the world with my best friend, and have a chance to win a huge prize without kissing Trump's tush.


  No. First time for everything. I'm sure we'll be great.
  It's weird, but in 17 years of friendship, Avi and I have never even taken a day trip together. This will be a long-overdue bonding vacation.


  Getting eliminated first.
  If I feared anything, I wouldn't be running THE AMAZING RACE. That said, I hope that I don't face a challenge with unkosher food, because I'm NOT compromising how I've lived my live, even for a million dollars.


  My main strengths are my logical mind and physical ability. I'm an excellent driver and very good with directions. My partner is the ""people person."" I'll be running them over; he'll be picking them up. My weakness is that sometimes I'm too gung-ho with my first idea about something. I don't take the time to see all the options.
  Strengths: amazing eyesight, eye for details, memory and sense of direction, and awesome skills at negotiation and persuasion. Weaknesses: I'm not the most athletic guy in the world, but I've been working with a trainer for almost two years, so it's time to see what I'm made of.


  Joe's best attribute is his ability to finesse things out of people. I'm only good with women and waiters; he's good with everyone, period. Joe's a holistic thinker and an excellent planner. He can see all the stuff I don't. Additionally, he's always been my moral compass; seems like I lost mine years ago.
  Avi is the more athletic of the two of us, and is a solid runner. He has patience and can be very charming to strangers. Most important, he's the devil to my angel: if we have to do something sneaky and cutthroat, then he's the man for the job. Avi's only weakness will be if I lose my comb, because that little bald man clearly won't be carrying a spare.


  My daughter. I speak to her every day. I can't imagine not hearing her voice say, ""Daddy"" for a whole month. I love her so much. It's going to be torture.
  I'll miss having Kosher food, the Mets, my friends and family (no matter how wacky they are), my really cool apartment at the beach, and yes, wifey (my new bride, Sharon), I'll miss you too.


  English, a lot of Spanish, some Yiddish (which is like German), a bit of French and Russian, too.
  I can speak enough Spanish to be conversational, and just enough Yiddish to be funny in a Catskills kind of way.


  Anything eastern. I do both Chinese and Japanese martial arts, so I hoping to visit those countries. I'd love to sit with the llamas in Tibet. And I'd really like to go to Peru and Costa Rica or Brazil to see the rain forest before it disappears.
  I'm hoping to see Japan, which I think is the most beautiful country out there. Italy would be cool, too.


  Any place they speak Spanish; it'll be easier for me to understand them. Also, any wild cities, like Bangkok. We're both city boys, the concrete jungle is our native element.
  The only countries I feel prepared for are all the countries I mentioned that I've been to. If we go there, hopefully, things will look familiar, and Avi and I will have an advantage.[2]
"
Azaria & Hendekea,"
This brother-sister Team has all the intelligence, wits and skills to win the Race, although their personality differences could be the X factor. She describes him as confrontational and emotional, while he describes her as irrational. Both are worried that the big brother/little sister power struggle will rear its ugly head during the Race.
Azaria lives in New Orleans where he works as a facilities engineer for offshore platforms. He enjoys playing sports, poker and building things. Azaria claims that the biggest difference between the two is he doesn't shy away from strenuous labor, while she is quite dainty. Hendekea moved to California several years ago and currently works as an aerospace engineer. She claims that he picked on her in high school, but now believes it was more of ""a love/hate relationship."" She describes herself as intelligent and honest.
These siblings just might have what it takes to carry them across the finish line, but they'll need to work together in order to reach that line.[1]

 Either winning a full-ride scholarship to college or being a cast member on The Amazing Race.
 I don't have a great sense of direction, so I'm most worried about getting completely lost in a foreign land.
 Getting to see the world! I've never been outside of the country, so experiencing different cultures will be awesome. I'm also excited to put myself in situations that the average human would never find themselves in.
I'm looking for someone who can stay positive in any situation. I want someone who understands that the race will not be a smooth ride, and they must be able to keep calm in the most stressful times.
 Someone who gives up easily.
 I feel like my partner may underestimate me because I'm one of the youngest racers, so it's possible that I'll have to prove myself to them early on.
 Definitely Italy. It has a rich arts and music culture and pasta is my favorite food.

 Being on this show is my biggest dream, so I just hope to push myself harder than I ever have before and enjoy the ride!

 Spunky, charismatic, and contemplative.
 Anything involving music, college sporting events, cuddling, and The Lion King.
 Being cast for The Amazing Race twice. That's pretty cool. Or serving as a drum major for CU's marching band.
 Losing my passport.
 Getting to experience the lives of other people. Every country is so unique and each feels like a different world, and I'm so lucky that I get to see other countries in a way that your average tourist can't.
 Australia and/or New Zealand. It's the only continent I haven't been to (besides Antarctica).
 To spread our joy to the world and have the time of our lives. Becca and I also still have a lot to learn about each other, so our relationship is surely about to get deeper!

 Definitely the Castaways. I feel like  can be psychologically tougher than the Race because it's more social and you're just sitting around alone with your thoughts. So I think the Castaways can handle themselves during the stressful moments. The Race is also physically and mentally challenging, and obviously, the Castaways are used to those kinds of conditions!

 Watching and playing sports, especially volleyball. I love to cook and bake - my favorites include chocolate chip cookies, meatballs, pasta and mashed potatoes! So naturally, I love eating all of my favorites! I also love to travel, even though I haven't done much of it!
 Not to sound cliché, but coming out and being proud of who I truly am to my friends and family, especially in a conservative Minnesota county, was one of my proudest accomplishments. I'm also really proud of where I am at with my career at only age 23.
 I think what scares me most about traveling is the language barrier, as well as getting lost and not knowing where I am is a little unsettling.
 I can't wait to see different cultures and experience the different ways that people live all over the world! To me that will be truly unforgettable, as it will open my eyes to things I haven't experienced before!
 It really depends how you consider ""serious."" I have been in 5 relationships, but none have gone longer than a year. Hopefully that will change soon!
 I can't date anyone that smokes, does drugs, has poor personal hygiene or has a tendency to cheat and lie.
 A good personality, has a good sense of humor and someone who makes me feel special and loved. I love nothing more than for my partner to make me laugh and smile each and every day!
 Smoking/bad breath, poor personal hygiene and bad kisser.
 Can't just pick one, so... Channing Tatum, Tom Daley and Zac Efron. I may be gay, but Jennifer Aniston is on the list too!
 Ellen DeGeneres, Oprah and Melissa McCarthy! Just wait till you meet me and the answer will explain itself!

Bilal & Sa'eed,"
Bilal & Sa'eed are best friends from Cleveland, Ohio who have spent the past 15 years bonding over their love of food, Browns football and their shared Islamic faith. Although they are extremely close, similarities between the two are hard to find. Bilal is outspoken and outgoing while Sa'eed is quiet and reserved. Nevertheless, Bilal's upbeat personality could be the spark that catapults this Team to victory.
Admittedly aggressive and determined, Bilal is the proud father of five children. Having served in the military, he has traveled the world and is eager to hit the road again.
Sa'eed is a father of two and works as a power lineman. He also served in the military, which allowed him to journey to such places as Philippines, China, Japan and Morocco. Sa'eed describes himself as passive, a self-starter and friendly. He and Bilal enjoy playing football and basketball together in their spare time.
Despite their personality differences, Bilal & Sa'eed may be a force to be reckoned with, given their traveling experience and determination to win. Their main reason for taking part in THE AMAZING RACE is to show the world a good example of a Muslim.[1]

BJ & Tyler,"
BJ & Tyler are bohemian best buds who first met four years ago during the Semester at Sea program, where they shared the experience of sailing around the world. One of their most memorable moments was starting a dance party in the streets of downtown Guilin, China, which turned into a mass gathering of hundreds of Chinese men. They have been friends ever since, whether bouncing on trampolines at Burning Man or spontaneously swimming in the San Francisco Bay.
BJ is a graduate of Harvard University, while Tyler graduated from UC Santa Cruz after completing two semesters abroad—one in Hungary, the other in South Africa. Both have traveled the world extensively and speak several languages including Spanish and Japanese.
Both BJ and Tyler share a love of adventure, travel, and good times. After graduating from college, BJ moved to California to pursue surfing, karate and frisbee. Meanwhile, Tyler fell in love with a Japanese girl and decided to impress her by walking the 2000-mile length of Japan.

"
Blake & Paige,"
“”Bio[]Brother and sister Blake and Paige have quite a bit of experience traveling together, mainly on family vacations. Both agree that those times were fun, because they were ""always entertaining each other and making each other laugh."" They disagree, though, on the downside of those vacations. Whereas Blake claims that ""the worst was Paige always getting special treatment, since she is 'Daddy's Girl'""; Paige insists that ""the worst was Blake doing everything possible to keep me away from any guys I met.""
The pair decided to team up for THE AMAZING RACE because they both love adventure but have not traveled much outside the U.S. They were separated all through college and saw this as a great way to reunite and do what they both love to do: compete. Blake thinks that participating in THE AMAZING RACE will enhance their relationship and provide them with stories to tell their friends for years to come. His only concern is that they both like to be in control of the situation. Paige worries that they'll drive each other crazy, but also has faith that their love and friendship will get them through the toughest times.
Q & A[]
 My strength and my weakness is my passion. It helps when I have to find that extra energy to complete a task, and it hinders me when making decisions, because I tend to make them with my heart and not with my mind.
 My weakness is that I tend to get really emotionally involved in what I'm doing. My strength is that I embrace adventure and physical challenges with passion. I am also pretty good under pressure.
 Paige is an incredibly supportive person. She is always there to encourage me, which is very important in a Race like this. Also, she is the toughest girl I know. Her only weakness, if she has any at all, is that she gets very emotional, which drains her of energy when subjected to difficult situations.
 Blake is an incredible motivator and his optimistic attitude will bring out the best of every situation. His weakness is that he gets very excited in pressure situations and makes rash decisions at times.

BioBefore the Race
Bob & Joyce are both widowers who lost their partners to cancer. Even though both lived in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, they met on an internet dating site and have been dating for over a year. Both claim that since they ran in different circles of friends, they never would have met one another if not for this website and have been loving life, and each other, ever since.
Bob has two adult children and Joyce has three, all of whom are very happy and supportive of their parents' relationship. Both say that they love new challenges, share a lot of the same moral, political and family values, have a very active lifestyle and are in good physical shape.

Bob & Joyce decided to do THE AMAZING RACE 5 ""to show that a smart, physically fit and a very compatible couple of age 50+ widowers can win this contest and beat a bunch of younger Teams.""[1]


 Joyce and I ""met,"" if you can call it that, on October 28, 2002, when I responded to her profile (description) on an Internet dating service. We met at a restaurant a few days later, and we are still together.
 November 1, 2002. We had our first date after meeting each other via an Internet dating service. We met at a café in New Jersey.


 Two widows in love, committed to each other and having the time of our lives. Getting a second change at love and life.
 We truly have a wonderful life together. We were both widowed for a while and alone, and now we have a second chance to have a wonderful life.


 We spent a weekend in New York City, weeklong vacations with friends at the beach on the North Carolina outer banks and at Williamsburg, Virginia, and a long weekend in Lake Tahoe for a wedding. Every one of these trips was a fabulous time for both of us. We are totally compatible travel mates. We like to do many of the same active things, we love being outdoors, are always on the go, enjoy great food and good conversation, and each trip was a fun adventure. The worst aspect, and only bad aspect of these trips, was that we had to return to separate households when we returned.
 Bob had traveled before; he is low-maintenance never complains. We are compatible in all respects.


 For the fun and adventure, of course. But the main reason is to try to let other folks who may be in the same situation we were before we met—widowed, lonely, wanting a better, fuller life—to let them know that they can make a new life for themselves, get out and try to meet someone as wonderful as we did and enjoy life again.
 Because we wanted to tell our amazing story. We love new challenges. We are physically fit and love to travel.


 I expect no big surprises. Joyce is a smart, physically fit, take-charge, focused, no-nonsense but fun-loving woman. I think it will only strengthen our relationship.
 I know it will be positive. I know we will have a ball.


 I am smart in an analytical way, and I am in great shape for someone my age. I don't get upset easily and can stay focused when all hell is breaking loose. My weakness is that I am naïve: I tend to believe everyone, and great shape at 61 years old is not too great. Also I am too analytical: I would spend too much time planning what to do next, rather than getting on with it.
 Bob is the analyzer; he is the planner. I put Bob's plans into effect. I add some spark to Bob; he is my rock. I will eventually do anything and enjoy it, and Bob loves to plan.


 Joyce is in great shape for her age and is very smart. She is a take-charge type who will let me do some planning, but who will then get us moving. She is extremely supportive and trusts my decisions without reservation. She is an extremely nice person whom people will want to help. Her weakness is a slight tendency to be overly concerned with mistakes already made, rather than forgetting them and worrying about the problems at hand.
 Bob and I make a dynamite combo. We are basically nice people. We have nice families. I am the sugar and spice, and my Bob is the meat and potatoes. What a winning Team![2]

 Married
Married for nine years, Brad and Victoria may not always see eye-to-eye, but they do make a dynamic team. They both have children from previous marriages, this is Victoria's third and Brad's second. Both endearingly concede that they are ""stuck with each other.""
Victoria was born with hip dysplasia and spent much of her childhood in hospitals, body casts and crutches. Following a recent major foot surgery, she was told that she could never run again. She is now out to prove that anything is possible. She claims that the biggest difference between her and Brad is that she is an optimist while he is cynical. However, she believes they share the same desires and like to be challenged both mentally and physically. Their motto is, ""life is not a spectator sport and therefore you should always enjoy each moment that life gives you."" Victoria works as a tax manager and Brad is a distribution dispatcher.
Brad describes himself as intelligent, straight forward and resourceful. One of his proudest achievements is overcoming drugs and alcohol addiction and remaining clean and sober for 25 years and counting. Brad enjoys pistol shooting, weightlifting and gardening.
This physically fit Team hopes to gain a lifetime of stories and a little bit of glue to reinforce their bond. Regardless of whether they win or lose, they already feel a sense of accomplishment by just being chosen to compete in the show.[1]

Brandon & Nicole,"


BioBefore the Race
Brandon & Nicole met just over a year ago at a Bridal Extravaganza in Houston, Texas. As reigning Miss Texas, she was there to model a new bridal gown, while Brandon was there as her escort on the runway. Right after the bridal show ended, Brandon got her telephone number, and they've been dating ever since. Both consider themselves very religious and spiritual people and describe their relationship as God-centered.
Brandon, a Texas A&M alum, is now a model and has lived in various big cities, including New York, Miami and Houston, while Nicole currently lives in Los Angeles and is pursuing an acting career. Nicole's proudest accomplishments have been winning Miss Texas USA 2003 and being the second runner up at Miss USA 2003.

Brandon & Nicole's primary motivation for being on THE AMAZING RACE 5 is to win the $1 million prize, but they also look forward to spending more time together, since their careers have kept them apart.[1]


 Niki and I met January 4, 2003 in Houston. She was the reigning Miss Texas USA. A regional bridal wear company and sponsor of the Miss Texas USA pageant had Niki debut a new bridal gown at the local Bridal Extravaganza. I was hired to model tuxedos and escorted Niki down the runway.
 I was Miss Texas USA and I modeled a bridal gown for the Bridal Extravaganza. Brandon was modeling a groom's tuxedo and was paired up with me to be my escort. He got my number after the show, and we've been together ever since.


 Our relationship is God-centered.
 Best friends.


 No.
 No.


 Niki and I spend a lot of time apart, because modeling keeps me on the road. We figure the Race will be a great opportunity for us to spend a lot of time together.
 There is no one I would rather spend my time, with so when I found out about the Race, I knew Brandon had to be my partner. We make such a good Team.


 I have no idea how the Race will be.
 I know that Brandon and I will get along great. We never really get to see each other, so I'm just looking forward to getting to see him for an extended period of time.


 I think I can be a good encourager for Niki. My biggest weakness is stress.
 I think I do a good job of staying focused and not getting discouraged. I am not a runner, so when it comes to anything that has to do with running I slow us down.


 Niki makes good decisions. Oftentimes, she's decisive when I'm not. She's really competitive, but easily discouraged.
 Brandon has a lot of strengths. He keeps me going when I feel down. When I'm tired, he carries me. He works really hard at whatever he does and usually finishes on top. Brandon is really laid back, so being firm and assertive isn't his strongest area. He sometimes can be a pushover. He is also not so patient with people when he is nervous. Other than that, he is perfect![2]
"
Bransen Family,"
The Bransen family team, from Park Ridge, Illinois, is made up of a father and his three daughters, who once appeared together in a Pert Shampoo commercial several years ago.
Walter, 51, the self-proclaimed leader of the group, has been married for 31 years. He works as a CFO and is a native of Chicago. The proud dad of five children, Walter describes himself as being reserved and analytical. He is also a history buff in regards to anything about Abraham Lincoln and belongs to the Abraham Lincoln Association.
Elizabeth, 25, is the oldest daughter. She recently obtained a Masters in Social Work from the University of Illinois. Elizabeth describes herself as personable and trustworthy and has a fear of heights. She and Walter have similar personalities and sometimes their stubbornness can cause friction between the two.
Lauren, 22, recently earned a Bachelor's degree in Communications and Business Management from Hope College. Punctual and adaptable, Lauren admits she can be impatient.
Lindsay, 20, is the youngest of the sisters. Currently, she's enrolled at Hope College, also majoring in Social Work. Lindsay complains that her older sisters are always telling her what to do.
The Bransens are well-traveled and eager to compete as a family for the chance to win the $1 million prize.[1]

 Currently, I am examining post-mortem brain tissue from Alzheimer's disease patients in an effort to correlate the pathology we saw using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging while the patient was still living with the disease. The field itself is tough, since so many individuals have or will have family members that will experience some form of dementia. In my lab at UCLA, we strive to find a biomarker that might be an early indicator at the onset of Alzheimer's disease, in which case we might be able to stop the disease before it heavily progresses.
 Not reading a clue properly and heading to the wrong location in the final leg.
 Taking a beautiful detour through the Ngorogoro crater in Tanzania and happening upon a pair of twin baby elephants. One of the baby elephants trumpeted as they walked around our safari jeep. It was one of those moments that we will remember for as long as we are alive.
 Tanzania, Africa.
 To win the $1 million so I can buy my beautiful wife a house and also we can… wait for it… have a baby!!! We live in Los Angeles, so this is pretty much what it costs!
 I am married to Rachel and I would like to think that our relationship has grown considerably and we won't be (knock on wood) arguing nearly as much during the Race!
 My family and my future children with Rachel. After racing around the world, you quickly realize how much money and possessions can never replace the people you have in your life. I am passionate about my science and trying to do something that will have a positive impact on the world.
 I was a competitive spelling bee kid when I was younger, and I absolutely hated it! I would sit at my house and read thousands and thousands of words and learn their root meanings. I enjoyed learning the words, but hated the competition itself. It is so nerve-racking for a child!
 Making sure we are passing the reigns to one another when the time is appropriate and not fighting each other over small things.
 Not listening to me. Just kidding! Rachel is an amazing racer and I am lucky to have her as my best friend and partner. Sometimes Rachel and I will both be too anxious in a task and rush, rather than making sure we are doing it correctly. So it is more of a team pet peeve!
 Africa is somewhere we will always want to go back and visit.
 Get to make some more memories with my beautiful wife and have a baby after winning the million dollars!
 We are going to make sure we read our clues carefully and make detour decisions more carefully.

 Season 20
 Actress, reality TV personality, journalist and owner of Adventures4pets.com
 I compete in reality shows including The Amazing Race and , as well as filming other reality lifestyle shows. Most people don't make a habit of doing competitive reality shows, but I keep getting asked back—obviously because I am so entertaining! I train for the shows mentally and physically for hours a day!!! I am going for the title of competitive reality TV tri-athlete, which means I will obviously have to compete on another CBS reality show.
 That would be trying to take a cab ride to Hawaii Pacific University. I really just wanted to spend more time in Hawaii, and knew if we won I wouldn't get asked back for another season… so it was a win win!
 The African Safari with my hubby. The romance and splendor of the birth in the African savannah; seeing the little baby twin elephants; witnessing baboons carrying their new born children; and romantic dinners at the end of every leg. Also, trying beers in every country we visited!
 Every place was amazing; it's hard to pick just one! That's like asking if I would rather play  or The Amazing Race again!
 My motivation to run the Race again stemmed from my deep need to compete on reality TV. I think that America, and the world, needed to watch another season of #Brenchel going at it! I have to give the fans what they ask for and they really wanted us back. Oh, and Brendon promised me if we win I can have a Brenchel baby!!!!!
 I think I am the same, just more awesome and experienced!! We also got married, so that probably made a difference.
 Other than being passionate about the hubs... I am passionate about sharing my life with America. Brendon and I fell in love while you were watching, we had our first kiss while you waited to see if we would get voted out of the house, we won money to start a family while you cheered us on, we traveled around the world on an adventure of a life time while you laughed at my tears, we got married and you shed tears with your besties. I love the entertainment industry; from competing on reality TV shows to filming my day to day life and making good TV.
 I am an artist and headband designer! You can buy my designs online. I also paint glass!
 Brendon and I just love each other too much and we always think the other one is right so it's hard to make a decision.
 My lil' bookie has no flaws; he's perfect in every way!
 I would like to scuba dive with sharks in the Pacific. You haven't lived until you've swam with sharks!
 I would like to have a Race baby, that way when we win the Race and have a baby we can tell them a really cool story about how they came into our lil' #brenchel family!

 I won't make any changes, since I am so competitive and have never been eliminated. Brendon and I want to have the record of the team never being eliminated… and winning The Amazing Race 24!!![2]

 Nashville, Tenn.
 Brian (Marketing Tour Manager) / Ericka (Entertainer/Miss America 2004)
 Married

Ericka and Brian Kleinschmidt are excited to be the first married interracial team on The Amazing Race. They have a singular game plan in mind — to win over the hearts and minds of The Amazing Race audience by proving that true love is color blind. They compare their relationship to the Yin-Yang symbol, which represents the philosophy of two total opposites coming together as one to accomplish a common goal.
Ericka and Brian met at a leadership seminar at the University of Central Florida nine years ago, and it was love at first sight for Brian. Ericka, on the other hand, played hard to get for the next five years….but Brian's persistence finally paid off as the couple shared wedding vows over two years ago.
Ericka has lived a very structured, prim and proper life but plans to embrace her true self and expose a vulnerable side of her life beyond Miss America while racing around the world. Her life's goal is to become a country music recording artist.
Brian is an all-American guy who contends that nice guys do not always have to finish last. He has enjoyed life as a standout athlete, singer, actor, and loyal friend. The opportunity to extensively tour the U.S. with his job as a sports and entertainment marketing manager has further boosted Brian's confidence and travel expertise.
Though some may see Brian and Ericka as total opposites, they believe that their differences are actually their greatest strength and will propel them around the world all the way towards the finish line.[2]

Brian & Greg,"
Brian & Greg are brothers from Santa Monica, California. Brian is an actor/bartender and Greg is a bouncer. Their primary motivation for participating in the Race is to travel the world with each other and meet new people.
Brian, the older of the two, graduated from Central Missouri State before moving to Los Angeles. Brian is at heart a competitor whose greatest accomplishment in life was starting every basketball game his high school varsity season after being cut the prior two seasons.
Greg graduated from Auburn University with a B.S. in Radio, Television and Film. In addition to earning his degree, Greg also saw playing time as a walk-on football player at Auburn. Competitive like his brother, Greg's favorite hobbies are playing basketball with his brother, tennis and horseback riding.
These two brothers are confident and ready to compete. Despite their limited traveling experience and knowledge of the Race, they're ready for the adventure of their lives.

 Language barriers and getting lost scare me. My sense of direction isn't great (so I plan to ask for help from a lot of locals), but my high school Spanish skills can only take me so far in most countries.
 Everything! I can't wait to see other cultures and different ways of life. I want to experience local customs and traditions, and I'm excited to see so much so quickly. I have loved this show from the moment I saw the first episode and every year I say, ""I could do that"". I am excited to see if I actually can.
 I hope my partner loves this game as much as I do and wants to win it just as badly. I also hope it's a guy who has brute strength because I have a feeling he's going to have to carry my backpack part of the way. I hope he has a similar sense of humor to me and that we can laugh our way around the world (although there will probably be a fair amount of yelling and crying too).
 I would be crushed to have a partner who isn't willing to work as a team or who isn't supportive when we are struggling. I feel like I can be a great cheerleader when someone is working through a hard task and I hope I get the same from my partner.
 If my partner and I are both super Type A we may battle for control. However, if my partner is completely laid back, I will have to stop myself from badgering them to keep up or make a decision.
 I'd either like to dive with sharks in South Africa, safari in Africa, or see Greece since my family is from that part of the world.
 I want to see the world. My passport has too many blank pages and I am hoping to fix that with this experience.[1]

 I source, interview and hire students for internships and entry-level jobs. I also set recruiting strategies for my firm, coach recruiters and manage budgets.
 Motivated, perceptive and competitive.
 Cooking, hiking, traveling, CrossFit, reading, game nights and volunteering abroad.
 Losing 40 pounds by changing my lifestyle with healthy eating and regular exercise. I learned I have strong willpower and no problem delaying gratification for a bigger reward.
 I'm not very good with foreign languages so I fear my inability to communicate clearly will be a problem.
 Adventuring into the unknown. Who will I meet? What will I experience? I love trying new things.
 I hope my partner is super motivated with an unending drive to win. I need someone ready to play a social game on top of a mental/physical game. A likeable personality will help us steer clear of getting U-turned. Intelligence, physical prowess and strong social skills are key.
 My partner can't get frustrated too quickly. He or she also shouldn't have the words ""I can't"" in his or her vocabulary.
 I'm deathly afraid of heights and falling, so my partner will need to complete those types of Roadblocks (bungee jumping, sky diving). Outside of that, I think we'll need to figure out how to build a trusting relationship quickly so we can rely on our collective strengths to stay ahead of the competition.
 I've wanted to experience Italy, where my ancestors lived, and Australia, my bucket list country. Both are gorgeous environments steeped in history.
 As a super fan, I'm looking forward to this life-changing experience of traveling the world while playing a game. I can't wait to experience vastly different cultures and prove that I can accomplish more than I ever imagined.[2]

 I really don't have any communication issues with Caroline. She is amazing at talking things through. My only concern is myself…I tend to hold things in that bother me.
 She used to be pretty self-righteous and that would irritate the hell out of me, but she has gotten a million times better. She does also have a hacking problem, haha.

Bio[]
Charla & Mirna are first cousins from Phoenix and Towson, Maryland, respectively. Both were born in the same hospital in Syria, one month apart. They emigrated to the United States when they were young children. Charla & Mirna know that physically they are quite different, but say they ""fill each other's gaps with strengths and weaknesses.""
Charla says she is married to the man of her dreams and is manager/co-owner of ten sportswear stores. She has a form of dwarfism and says she ""certainly does not consider it a physical illness."" In fact, she says she hopes ""to show the world what I can do and break all stereotypes about dwarfs!""
Mirna is an attorney who graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law at age 23, the youngest in her class. While she describes herself as ""sometimes too bossy and controlling,"" she blows off steam by doing some favorite activities such as running and cycling. Mirna also claims to be a frequent winner at blackjack tournaments.
Charla & Mirna describe themselves as ""a unique team, definitely one of a kind, extremely comical and aggressive"" and are excited about competing in THE AMAZING RACE 5 so that they can travel around the world and win.[1]

Before the Race[]


 We are cousins; we were born one month apart in the same hospital in Aleppo, Syria.
 Our moms are sisters, and we were born on the same day one month apart.


 We are full of laughter and always having fun.
 Sister-like, full of fun and energy.


 Yes, we traveled together many times, and we always have the best time because we bring excitement and laughter everywhere we go and to all the people we meet.
 Yes, we have traveled together. The best aspect is that we meet and greet new and exciting people and create laughter and joy. The worst aspect: the fun always ends too soon.


 We both love the show, love to travel and love excitement.
 Traveling is our number one hobby. We balance each other's strengths and weaknesses, and together we make one heck of a dynamic duo.


 This experience will make our relationship even stronger because we will have to depend on each other and trust one another, which will form a special bond with great memories to share for a lifetime.
 The Race will strengthen our relationship and bond, as we are forced to work together under such intense conditions.


 I'm always willing to do anything fearlessly to accomplish my goals, but of course, nothing immoral or hurtful against anybody. My weakness is that I will not be able to run as fast as other people on the Race.
 I'm determined, motivated and will work without eating or sleeping to ensure victory. And I'm a fast runner. I learned how to drive a manual transmission car just before the Race began.


 Mirna's strength is having the physical strength to do any task, especially using her strong arms or fast legs. Mirna's weakness is that she's sometimes overly analytical.
 Charla is just as determined and motivated as me, and mentally, she is strong enough to eat any odd food. She is not as fast a runner, but will surely make up for it in other ways.[2]
The inspirational cousins from Season 5 are back for another trip around the world. Charla and Mirna have both made numerous television appearances since their time on Race and are eager to capture America's heart once again. Both are now married and ready to start a family. 
A highly competitive team during their season, Charla, who stands at 4 feet tall, describes herself as dedicated, passionate and driven to succeed. Mirna describes herself as hard working, a leader, but with a comical side. Her greatest achievement is obtaining her Juris Doctorate at age 23. 
Charla proved just how strong she was when she threw a 50 pound slab of meat over her shoulder and helped carry it a quarter of a mile in order to complete a challenge with Mirna. Growing up together taught them how to work well with each other. Both are well traveled and speak several languages. 

This motivated duo is proud of the way they played the game last time around and are eager for another opportunity to win the $1 million prize.[3]

"
Chip & Kim,"


BioBefore the Race
Chip & Kim have been married for over 25 years, are raising three children and reside in Coto de Caza, California. They met at a party in the summer of 1978. Kim caught Chip's eye as she was on the dance floor doing ""the freak"" in her Jordache jeans. When Chip introduced himself to Kim and asked if he could treat her to a drink of her choice, she flatly refused. He was undaunted, however, and kept persisting, finally obtaining her phone number. At first, Kim was not interested in Chip at all, but over time, he managed to change her image of him, especially when she saw him two months later cruising down Crenshaw Boulevard in his brand new royal blue 280Z sports car.
Kim is the owner of an information technology recruiting company. She says that her proudest accomplishment is marrying Chip and having their three children, Elon, Phillip III and Kristen. She says that she and her teammate are soul mates with the same life goals who want the best for each other.
Chip is the owner of a web technology company. Aside from marrying Kim, he said his second biggest accomplishment was finishing college at age 38. He said he most resembles boxer George Foreman, minus his money, and his wife looks like Olympic runner Florence Griffith Joyner!

Chip & Kim say they decided to apply for THE AMAZING RACE 5 because ""several of our friends and family members have made calls to us to express their strong feelings as to why we should be on the show. That is why we started watching. Now, THE AMAZING RACE is our favorite show.""[1]

 We officially met at a party in the recreation room of the Oakwood Garden Apartments in Marina Del Rey in 1978. I was so spellbound with Kim's beauty that, though she was not overwhelmed with me, I persisted to get her phone number…then her heart. I saw the diamond in the rough.

 We praise God that we have one of the most healthy and happy marriages that we know of. By design, Kim and I spend approximately 23 hours a day together. We work, play, exercise, eat, party, sleep, love, laugh, argue, fuss and strategize together. We are soul mates, due to our life priorities.

 We have traveled together throughout many of the United States, Hawaii included. We have also traveled to Jamaica, Cancun, the Bahamas and Virgin Islands. We love most aspects of traveling together. Since I am a large individual, I am especially uncomfortable sitting in very small coach seats.

 One of our favorite television shows is THE AMAZING RACE. Also, Kim and I are very competitive. We always aim to win at anything in which we participate. Kim absolutely loves to travel, and I love to compete in athletic competitions. So it was natural for us to want to participate in THE AMAZING RACE.

 Kim and I have absolutely no expectations as far as THE AMAZING RACE affecting our relationship. We know that we have a strong relationship going into it.

 I am an ex-athlete (not professional). I can do most athletic things well. I also have good people skills. I am the heart of our Team. I make certain that others are well managed while we win. My weakness is that I may care too deeply for my competitors because they can't win too.


 Kim is a fierce competitor: she must win! Kim is also the consummate strategist. She is the brains and passion of our Team. She is unable to discuss anything less than winning it all; she is a winner! Kim's weakness is that she may not consider other competitors' feelings.[2]
"
Chris & Alex,"
“”

BioQ & A
Chris and Alex met on the school bus heading for their first day of kindergarten, and have been friends ever since. They've traveled extensively together, logging ""about a million miles on road trips."" According to Alex, ""The best thing about traveling with Chris is that he is just as crazy as I am."" Chris counters with his own assessment: ""The best aspects of traveling with Alex are his extensive travel experience and his uncanny ability to get us into some very interesting situations. The only weakness he has is that he's a loose cannon, but you get used to that.""

Going into the Race, Chris and Alex speculate about how the experience might affect their relationship. ""Since day one we were like brothers,"" says Chris, ""and even an amazing experience like THE AMAZING RACE wouldn't change us being like family."" Alex agrees: ""Chris and I have stayed friends through thick and thin. Nothing, not even this Race, would affect things between us. No matter if Chris makes a good or bad decision on the road, I will back him 100%.""[1]


 The strengths I bring to the table are my level-headedness and the ability to think through situations and determine all the options and the best course of action. The inherent weakness of being like this is that my decisions aren't spur-of-the-moment or impulsive like they sometimes have to be.
 I have an extensive amount of travel experience. I also speak a few languages. I have probably done more than most at the age of 24. It would be tough to put me in a situation that would intimidate me. My weakness is most likely my impulsiveness. I don't always think before I act.


 Alex has a good head on his shoulders and quick decision-making skills. The only drawback to this is that even though he's smart, he sometimes doesn't think things through and runs around with his head cut off for a while
 Chris is one of the smartest people I know. He has two engineering degrees and a minor in Spanish. He can mastermind a game plan like no other. Chris is also one of the strongest competitors I know. Chris's weakness is probably his confidence making quick decisions. He sometimes ponders over a problem when he already knows the answer.

: Chris & Alex incurred a retroactive 42-minute penalty for speeding. Their penalty was issued after their check in, but because they were the penultimate team to arrive in the previous leg, they still departed last on the following leg.

 Flight Attendants
These two savvy flight attendants met while working on a Southwest Airlines flight six years ago where they made an instant connection. Both admit to being extremely competitive and determined to win.
Christie and Jodi agree they have different personalities, but are confident these differences will be used as a strength on the Race. Christie claims that she is more analytical while Jodi is the reactive one. Her biggest pet peeve about Jodi is that she reacts too fast, while Jodi's pet peeve with Christie is that she asks too many questions.
Christie, who recently married, describes herself as realistic, opportunistic and street-smart. Her primary motivation for running the Race is to challenge herself and to have an experience of a lifetime before she settles down and starts a family.
Jodi is using this experience to test what she is made of. As a divorced, single mother, she lives for her daughter and wants to prove to her that you can accomplish any goal you set your mind to. She describes herself as strong-willed, determined and independent. Jodi enjoys beach volleyball, snow skiing and traveling.
During their 25 years of combined traveling experience, Christie and Jodi have become well-versed in all the ins-and-outs of the travel industry and they're eager to put that valuable knowledge to good use.[1]

 Thoughtful, fun-loving and hard-working.
 Trying new cuisines, shopping and baking.
 Earning my professional degree. My parents left Vietnam when I was only 1.5 months old in search of a better future in the United States for us 6 kids. They always emphasized the importance of education and hard work so I studied hard and worked even harder to get to where I am professionally today. Definitely no silver spoons here!
 Drew Barrymore in her many romantic comedies - light hearted, fun-loving and charming.
 Edward Cullen from . Pale...really, really pale, glistening skin, thin, blazing eyes - but his love is eternal!
 Jetlag- the struggle is real! It's hard resting your internal clock! But I think with the race and all the adrenaline, it'll help keep me moving!
 Seeing and experiencing different cultures and food. I love different foods! I'll eat anything- as long as it's edible and not gross and sinful!
 My husband is very confrontational. He wants to address each and every problem head on- whether it is major or minor and I find it exhausting! I want us to be able to communicate productively, without me secretly rolling my eyes at him.
 He's not a good listener. He loves to talk but when it comes to listening, he only hears what he wants to hear. It's so frustrating. It's like I'm wasting my breath sometimes because I'll say one thing and it'll just go in one ear and out the other!
 I love tropical places such as the Caribbean, Fiji and Bora Bora. Definitely would love to see Australia and New Zealand because I love the Australian accent. Hoping to pick up the accent along the way, mate!
 Rick and I both have achieved great success individually in our lives thus far. But put us together and we're the clash of the Titans! I hope to be able to work well with my husband and learn to pick my battles and know when to put my stubbornness aside, especially because we want to start a family soon!

 Nothing really. I wanted to live in the airport when I was a kid. Losing my passport would be a fear I guess.
 Seeing new places, experiencing different cultures and learning about the local customs. I try to learn a new language each time I travel.
 Because we're both professionals, we like things done our way. We're both very stubborn; sometimes she won't admit I'm right just to stand her ground.
 Her messiness. Her hair is everywhere. Sometimes, she cries over the smallest things.
 I would love to race to China and Vietnam as I've never been to China and Cindy has never been to Vietnam- both with history tied to our roots!
 We're still learning about each other on a daily basis. We fight and we're thinking of starting a family. The past year has been difficult. We need something like the Amazing Race to find each other again. Spend time together and see if we have what it takes to be teammates and future parents.

The Amazing Race 5The Amazing Race 31
Bio[]
Colin & Christie met in a class at the University of Texas in Austin and have been dating for over a year. Both now live in Corpus Christi, Texas. When Colin saw Christie give a presentation in their communications class, he knew that she was the one for him. It took eight months of being friends before he finally got her to go out on a date with him. Colin claims that he will ask Christie to marry him if they can get through the Race together.
Christie is the 1996 Miss Teen USA winner, the first and only one from Texas. However, she considers her biggest accomplishment in life to be working to pay her entire way through college and graduating with honors. She describes herself and her teammate as ""very competitive, extremely aggressive with strong personalities."" Although Christie says that she is always late, she is also a perfectionist who hates losing.
Colin is the owner of a cell phone store. Among the accomplishments he is most proud of is getting Christie to fall in love with him, which he claims is better than being the top first-year dealer for a book publishing company in the United States. He also agrees that he and Christie are both very aggressive and ""very outspoken and in-your-face."" However, he is a very open person who will talk to anyone, while Christie is extremely private.
Colin & Christie are excited about competing in THE AMAZING RACE 5 because they will be able to travel the world and participate in this kind of competition. Christie adds, ""Another reason for doing this Race is that it is a test to see if we are marriage potential. I know we can win, and if we do, we're getting married right after the show.""[1]

Before the Race[]

 We met at the University of Texas at Austin in Communications Theory class. It was the spring of 2002. Colin had long hair down to his shoulders in those days, and came to class everyday with his carve board, laptop and something to say every single day! He started overtly flirting with me, but more in an ""it's never going to happen"" kind of way. Eventually my best friend and I decided to ask him for notes, since he used his computer. Of course, he said yes, but not without setting up a study group and getting my phone number. After that we became friends, until one day about nine months later I woke up and realized I was completely in love with him!

 We were made for each other!

 The best part of traveling together is just that: We get to be together all the time. I think we start to go through withdrawal if we spent too much time apart. The worst is our need to be in control. We each want to do it our own way, and usually feel it's the best way to go. When traveling, this way of thinking can lead to a lot of conflict.

 We are both super competitive, love to travel, and look forward to new and interesting challenges. There is no doubt that for this type of challenge, together our Team has everything it takes to win.

 We are hoping it will bring us closer together and help us learn new things not only about ourselves, but about each other as well.


 Our strengths: We are competitive, athletic, clever, good at getting the best flights and great at getting what we want out of ourselves and, more importantly, out of other people. Our weaknesses: We both think we are always right, both of us like to lead, and in a way, this creates a certain amount of competition with each other. Obviously, this could seriously slow us down if it becomes a problem on the Race.[2]

 Watching myself run  15 years ago gave me the opportunity to look in on myself from the outside and see just how unconscious and full of ego my behavior was. Since then, I have done many years of work to broaden my perspective and come from a more loving and collaborative mindset. I hope to enter this engineered reality that is designed to bring on extreme stress and reduce resilience and apply the principles and practices that have transformed my daily life to see if they can help me have a much more harmonious experience while still being every bit as competitive as we were the first time around.
 Racers, without a doubt.  is very different than the other shows in that the competitors are out in the real world having to navigate countries with different cultures and language, dealing with uncontrollable flight delays, lack of sleep, jet lag, etc. I think the people who have experienced that before, and proved to be successful in that environment, will be our biggest competition.

 Integrated Sex, Love, and Relationship Coach
 I use my intuitive abilities and energetic healing tools to help clients process past trauma stuck in the body often keeping them in a constant loop of mediocre relationships and life experiences. I combine traditional ""top down"" talk therapy with a more somatic ""bottom up"" approach utilizing various types of breath-work, sound healing, meditation, and Reiki in order to encourage my clients to go deep within the self to uncover and/or simply release thought patterns no longer serving their best and highest good. I invite them to reclaim their sovereignty by reconnecting with their own internal emotional guidance system; thus, becoming a more expressed human, free of cultural and familial programming, inspired to live their own authentic truth.
 Adventurous, curious, and fun.
 Hiking, yoga, travel, reading, camping, wake-surfing, snowboarding, paddle boarding, slack-lining, dancing, and playing hide-and-go-seek with my kids.

Cyndi & Russell,"
“”Bio[]Cyndi and Russell met in the tenth grade at Hutchinson High School in Hutchinson, Minnesota. Cyndi was a new transfer student that year, and the two have been together ever since. During their 28-year marriage, they have traveled together many times. Because they live in a cold place, they like to head south to the ocean for a couple of weeks in winter; thus their best travel experiences usually involve lying on a beach. According to Cyndi, ""Our worst travel experience is when I have tried to 'get by cheap' and we end up in a dive and have to scramble for a hotel at the last minute.""
Russell and Cyndi decided to team up for THE AMAZING RACE ""to face the challenge of racing around the world, seeing all the beautiful locations, but most importantly, building a lifetime memory with each other."" As they approach the starting line, they resolve that ""win or lose, we will allow this experience to draw us closer together. Our relationship with God and each other cannot be measured in any dollar amount.""
Q & A[]
 The strengths I bring to the Team would be an optimistic attitude, travel reservation experience, and getting us through a foreign airport. The weaknesses I would have is the lack of muscle power and trying to find my way out of any kind of wilderness.
 Russell's best strength for our Team will be his ability to lead us through any remote locations like a jungle or desert, plus his muscle power to carry his own weight and probably most of mine too. His only weakness is trying to keep a positive attitude no matter what.

 I am most proud of all the countries I have visited! When I was younger, travel didn't seem like a real possibility and I am really proud that I have made that part of my life.
 Nothing really scares me about travel! I don't love the idea of becoming ill in a foreign country. I got sick in China once and that wasn't my favorite experience.
 I love everything about travel, seeing new places and meeting new people is so thrilling to me. It's so cool to see these places I've obsessed over in the pages of travel magazines. There's nothing like being in a new place and experiencing a new culture- it's one of the greatest things in life.
 We are both so stubborn and always like to be in control. We will definitely find ourselves in a few power struggles.

I also have a major issue letting go of control, so I hope that being out of my comfort zone while racing will help me to get over that and be more comfortable to not be in control of every situation.

Danielle & Dani,"
Danielle & Dani are childhood friends hailing from Staten Island, New York. The two beauties met over 10 years ago and have been inseparable ever since.
Outgoing and talkative, Danielle, who recently graduated from St. Johns University with a degree in Speech Pathology, has limited experience when it comes to traveling abroad and is eager to see what this globetrotting adventure has to offer.
Dani recently graduated at the top of her class from Wagner College. She describes herself as being fun-loving, wild and eager to get out of Staten Island. Like her teammate, Dani also hasn't traveled very much. She hopes the Race will provide her with the chance to explore all the different cultures in the world.
Armed with bold personalities and a fearless attitude, the duo believes that anything is possible with good looks and thick accents, which they aren't afraid to use if it helps them to win the $1 million prize.[1][2]

 Ambassador of Laughter
 My wife and I work for Ringling Bros. We visit cities and bring educational programs and laughter to schools, hospitals, libraries and kids who might not get a chance to see the show.
 As ambassadors of laughter we understand the international language of comedy and how it can connect our world.
 Lucky, friendly and easy going.
 Geocaching, playing games and sight seeing.
 Tom Hanks
 Lucille Ball
 Having the courage to walk into a clown college audition for the second time. It changed my life forever.
 Injuries or possibly even worse.
 Seeing the places I've read about in National Geographic.
 She sometimes thinks she know everything. Nine out of 10 times she does, but I still like to argue for the 10%.
 She can be painfully honest.
 Japan, because the culture and history is very intriguing.
 This is a dream come true. I want to celebrate our 20 year anniversary running around the world and having the adventure of a lifetime!

 As ambassadors of laughter, my husband and I get to bring free programs to schools, libraries, hospitals, etc. We bring a little circus to kids who might not be able to attend the big show while getting the word out on TV, radio and newspapers that Ringling Bros is coming to town.
 Clowning is a universal language. Plus, we're used to working and traveling together. We have a ""show must go on"" attitude!
 Spoiled, logical and friendly.
 Geocaching, Harry Potter books and sight seeing on days off while traveling for work.
 Lucille Ball
 Forrest Gump
 Even though I never got into Ringling Bros. Clown College, I was able to not only perform in the show for five years, but become one of the two full-time ""Ambassadors of Laughter"" for the Greatest Show on Earth.
 Being separated from Dave without knowing how to find him.
 Finally getting to see and experience more of the world.
 I don't usually speak up unless I know I'm right. We would save a lot of time if Dave would just listen to me the first time. 98% of the time we do things my way so why bother arguing about it?
 When he says he will do something and doesn't – or he forgets.
 Australia. I've always wanted to go, but it is so far away and very expensive. I've been told it's really beautiful.
 I think it will be a great way for us to celebrate 20 years of marriage and create memories of a lifetime.

 I purchase and operate investment properties around the United States. As the father of a large family, I work hard, play hard and view my job as a means to an end and not the end itself.
 Active, enthusiastic and strong-willed.
 Cycling, fly fishing and snow skiing.
 Being the father of five great kids and the grandfather of six even greater grandkids!
 People have told me I look like Steve Martin but personally I don't remind myself of anyone.
 The inability to communicate in different languages.
 New cultures, places and things to see!
 We are both stubborn and think we're right most of the time (I'm right all the time)!
 Connor is messy and doesn't put things away.
 Thailand. I would like to experience culture truly foreign to me. I would love to experience the diversity of terrain, food, language, culture and activities.
 I hope to gain an unforgettable experience with my son and to celebrate the health that we both now enjoy! Also, my son has wanted to do this for years and he wants to earn the money I am so grateful that I have this opportunity.

 We are both hard headed, we both think we are right much of the time, so working on humbling ourselves and working more as one.
 This sounds ridiculous, but how he chews his food! He chews his food so loud and for so long. I can't even believe I'm putting that down, but it pisses me off so bad. I can't even explain it. It seems to just be him that does it.
 India or China. The culture and the diversity intrigue me.

 An incredible experience with my father, and to show that anything is possible. Two cancer survivors can come back from incredible odds and do hard things.

 By not reading a clue completely, we had to go back to retrieve our dive gear bag, which made us lose precious time. While running to the mat, I ruptured my Achilles tendon and tore my calf muscle.
 Winning the fourth leg in Bali while on crutches.
 Bali
 Really wanted to see how far we could go without an injury - could we get further than we did while on crutches?
 Running with a surgically repaired Achilles and recovering calf muscle, and maybe a little more prepared in terms of having an idea what to expect. Also a year older, which at my age can be significant.
 My family, faith, cycling, outdoors and travel.
 That I have five children (Connor is the youngest and the only boy) and that I have seven grandchildren.
 Communication. We are both strong willed and think we are right most of the time. We will need to try and work together when we both think we need to be going somewhere else, or doing something different.
 He can be kind of messy. He will not worry as much as I do about what is coming and what we need to do to be prepared.
 I would like to visit Myanmar as I understand it has not yet been Westernized with American and international businesses such as McDonalds, etc.
 Hope to prove to myself that I could make it further than we did in the prior season and that we can compete against some of the most experienced teams ever on the Race.
 My objective is to never be last on any leg and be first on the last leg. We need to slow down and think about what we are going to do before we rush off without understanding exactly what we need to do. NOT RUPTURE ANYTHING.

 Student and professional cyclist
 I race bicycles, and I am a senior at the University of Utah.
 We made a lot of mistakes the first time around, but the one that stands out is definitely when we forgot our dive bags on the second leg. It forced us to waste a lot of energy, and may have cost us my dad's torn Achilles.
 Jumping out of a helicopter in Bora Bora on the first leg. Does it get any better, or more memorable than that?
 My favorite place we went last season was definitely Indonesia. It was such an awesome place, and we had the opportunity to be immersed in the culture. It was amazing.
 Our Race was cut short last time. My dad had an injury that required us to withdraw, and to have this second chance is amazing. I want to show what a father and son can do.
 I personally haven't changed much since we last competed. It was only a year ago, so I am a year older, but most importantly, my dad is healthy, and hopefully we can compete this time around without any injuries.
 I am passionate about my family, friends, the outdoors and my religion.
 I love to cook. I would love to open up a little café or juice bar/salad shop.
 We are both extremely hard-headed, and both think we are right all the time… we are both usually wrong.
 When he flosses his teeth (which is about 10x a day), and when he chews.
 I would love to go to either China or India. They are two places I have never been. They both have such rich customs, cultures and traditions, and it would be amazing to see.
 To have an amazing experience with my Dad. He isn't getting any younger, and our chances to do something like the Race are getting smaller. Just having the opportunity to spend this time with my dad is worth more than a million dollars.

 We really need to focus on slowing down and reading our clues. I also want to try and keep my old man in one piece, which is the primary goal, and has proven to be tough."

 I've traveled pretty extensively through Europe. Aside from that, I like to take weekend trips from LA to the mountains skiing, etc.
 Extensively traveled the USA and abroad (Europe) by plane, taxi to hotel (never via backpack!).


 Waiting. Patience is not exactly one of my greatest strengths.
 Getting into airports, checking in, security and waiting!


 The pictures of my girl, Stephanie, and the notes she snuck into my bag before I left. These are the things that keep me going the most. Anything else can be replaced.
 My passport, for the obvious reason and my shoes, because of the amount of time I will spend on my feet.


 To travel around the world, try to win a million bucks and sit around with my friends, watching myself do crazy shit and act like an idiot on TV.
 Opportunity to circle the globe in a very short period of time while experiencing a variety of challenges and cultures.


 Actually, no.
 No, not to this extent.


 Not winning.
 Analysis paralysis or a Roadblock with which I have no previous experience.


 Fun and a positive attitude.
 Strengths: strategic thinker, drive, intelligence and positive attitude. Weaknesses: overly social and stubbornness.


 Strengths: the ability to figure things out. Weaknesses: I'm not sure, but every time we make a mistake, I'm pretty sure I'm going to blame him!
 Strengths: motivation, focus, quick thinker. Weakness: can be a little slow moving.


 Come on, that's an easy one! Someone to sleep (or NOT sleep all night) with me.
 Interaction and time with friends and my gal, daily life at the beach, running.

David & Mary,"


The Amazing Race 10The Amazing Race: All-Stars
David & Mary are a husband and wife Team from Stone, Kentucky. They met while working at a McDonald's 10 years ago and have been inseparable since. The proud parents of three children, David works as a coal miner and Mary is a stay-at-home mom. Their primary motivation for being on THE AMAZING RACE is to expand their horizons and see what the world holds outside of the ""Bluegrass State."" 
David served in the Army before becoming a coal miner, a job he loves. He describes himself as a risk taker, hard working and outgoing. David claims that his biggest accomplishment is being the first person in his family to get his boss papers. His biggest phobias are spiders and deep water. 
Mary believes that the greatest difference between her and her husband is that she is more cautious. Just last year, she took her very first vacation and was instantly bitten by the travel bug. Mary wants to compete on the Race to prove to her husband that she is strong and not a quitter. 

Since Mary can count the number of times she's been on an airplane on one hand, will this hard working couple be able to navigate their way through four continents and 13 countries without getting lost?[1]
Everybody's favorite coalminer and his wife are back for another trek around the world. David and Mary, the lovable, wide-eyed couple from Stone, Ky., finished sixth in the 10th installment.
The Conley's met at the local McDonalds over 11 years ago and have been married for nearly 10 years. They are the proud parents of three children.
After falling short of the $1 million prize, Mary was adamant that she and David would not sign up for another Race and leave their children again, but something tells her that they have what it takes to win the million dollars this time around.
Both have limited traveling experience outside of the Race. David spent some time traveling while enlisted in the U.S. Army while Mary took her first plane ride after being cast on the show.

A bona fide reality TV junkie, will Mary be able to restrain her excitement and stay focused while racing alongside some of her favorite racers from past seasons? Will they be able to find an alliance as strong as the Season 10 ""6 pack"" or will their desire to win the money for their children be enough to carry them across the finish line?[2]

 Adventurous, competitive, and honest.
 Traveling, video games, and board games.
 Being the first person in my family to graduate from college while also achieving my dream of making it to the NFL.
 Nothing. I love everything to do with it but I guess if I had to pick something it would be being in the middle seat on a long flight.
 Everything because I love to learn about the new cultures and see everything the country has to offer, while also trying to find something adventurous to do.
 Well, I have visited my top three choices so I feel like any of those would be great: Egypt, Iceland, and New Zealand. If I had to pick somewhere I haven't been, I would say Peru to do something with Machu Picchu.
 Just get that adrenaline going again because when you are retired you don't get that competitive environment again, so this allows us to achieve that environment in a race around the world. Also just getting a chance to see so many countries is another big plus. Our main goal is to make it to every country.
"
Debbie & Bianca,"
Debbie & Bianca are best friends from Los Angeles, California and Woodbridge, Virginia, respectively. Bianca is a high school teacher and Debbie works as a photographer.

Bianca graduated from James Madison University with a B.A. in International Affairs and Spanish Art History. She currently works as a high school teacher and is finishing her master's degree of Education (with a concentration in multicultural studies). Bianca's favorite hobbies are traveling, reading and going out with friends.

Debra & Steve,"


BioQ & A
""We come across as a sweet, loving couple, but we're not!"" Debra, 49, has two grown kids from a previous marriage. They've been married 8½ years, after meeting on a coed softball team Debra ""started in order to meet single men."" She holds a BA from Northeastern University, an MA from the University of Oklahoma, and is currently director of an artist's colony. Debra considers herself ""bawdy, outgoing and driven,"" and enjoys walking, painting and traveling. She's afraid of ""heights and dark waters,"" and sometimes has trouble with her husband/teammate's devotion to his work: she gets jealous. Debra blows off steam by cleaning the house, and admits that she can be a ""controlling and dominating know-it-all."" She speaks no foreign languages, but has traveled to France, Mexico and Canada. She refuses to eat fish, according to Steve. She's outgoing and pushes boundaries, while Steve is more cautious and reserved, and ""always follows the rules."" Says Debra, ""I raised money for opera in Oklahoma. I think I can do anything.""

""We can be sneaky, snide and devious,"" says Steve, 40, a radio news director. He jokingly claims that he met Debra through ""The Great Softball Conspiracy"" perpetrated by his wife, but considers their wedding the most exciting moment of his life. His wife/teammate reminds him of Bonnie Hunt. Steve holds a BA from the University of Scranton. He describes himself as ""fun, smart and deceptive,"" but regrets that ""sometimes I let opportunities slip through my hands."" Steve speaks no foreign languages and has traveled to Canada, Mexico, France, Germany and Belgium. He counts ""people skills"" among his finer traits.[1]


 Moderate: extensive travel in the States some travel in Canada, Mexico and France.
 I have traveled throughout the US, Germany and Belgium. Debra and I have also spent time in Canada, Mexico and France.


 Not being in total control.
 Being in a crowded place, where I don't speak or read the language. (It's also the most fun!)


 Notebook with pen. When info is needed in foreign locations, can be used for locals to write helpful info in both English and the country's native language.
 A fresh pair of socks. Your pants can be dirty, your shirt can be soaking wet. But a pair of clean, dry socks are good for another 20 miles hiking.


 A once-in-a-lifetime chance to travel the world and be together with my husband with few interruptions.
 It's a chance to see things, do things and be places Debra and I could never have imagined.


 Yes. We compliment each other very well. Steve can be a very calming influence, and there is no one else I'd rather be with.
 Debra and I take long cross-country road trips (10 hours or more) fairly regularly. It gives us a chance to focus on each other and have fun.


 Other than heights, I'm so excited about what's ahead I'm not feeling any fear.
 Being one and done.


 Strengths: organized, competitive, sense of humor. Weaknesses: sometimes my competitive streak gets out of control.
 I'm our Team's muscle (which I guess is our weakness). And I'm the steadying force (which, hopefully, is a strength).


 Strengths: determination, kindness, intelligence. Weaknesses: sometimes too nice, follows the rules to the T.
 Debra's the brains of the organization, but sometimes her competitiveness gets the best of her.


 Our pets, Switzer (beagle) and Clarence (yellow Persian cat)
 Our beagle (Switzer) and our Persian (Clarence). The two of them push me out of bed in the morning.

When they travel, Hillary's pet peeve is when Deidre combs her hair and gets it all over the bathroom floor. But ""she is so much fun to be around,"" Hillary adds, ""We laugh like crazy people when we are together.""
Deidre and Hillary decided to team up for THE AMAZING RACE because, in Hillary's words, ""Who wouldn't want two SENSATIONAL girls to make the world laugh?"" She adds, ""I think this experience will help my mom see life through my eyes and understand me more as a friend and not only as a daughter.""
Q & A[]
 I prefer to think things through rather than jump to conclusions. I'm also mature and have a good sense of humor. On the other hand, I tend to procrastinate and take too long making decisions.
 I am a ham and I'm too controlling. Maybe more like a rebel, a cross between polka dots and blue paisley or Bob Marley and Gwen Stefani?
 My daughter has many strengths: she's rebellious, free spirited and individualistic. She's everybody's best friend. She does, however tend to be too controlling.
 My Mom is a cross between Jackie Brown, Ru Paul and the Crocodile Hunter. Hopefully, all personalities can come together and eat off each other's plates.

"
Dennis & Andrew,"
“”

BioQ & A
Lexington, Kentucky residents Dennis and Andrew are different as night and day. Andrew, 21, is a liberal, openly gay, college cheerleader. His father Dennis, 48, is a conservative Southern Baptist who manages a family entertainment center.
Dennis says he decided to apply for THE AMAZING RACE so he could spend some quality time with his son. ""I would love to travel with Andrew outside the country before he moves on and starts his own life,"" said Dennis.
Andrew says his primary motivation was to see the world. ""The thrill of traveling to places unknown to me seems very intriguing,"" said Andrew. ""My second motivation would be to give Kentuckians someone to root for!""
Both Dennis and Andrew are concerned about keeping clean on the road. Andrew says the most important item in his backpack is his razor, since he hates looking scruffy. Dennis is making sure to pack plenty of soap. ""Other than food, sanitation is the key to health. If you are not feeling well, nothing else matters,"" he says.
The father-and-son Team feel their diversity will prove to be an asset in the Race. While Dennis has experience and wisdom on his side, Andrew's strength, agility and charisma may help lead the Team toward the finish line.

Andrew attends Eastern Kentucky University. His birth date is June 15. Dennis' birth date is January 14.[1]


 Above average. I have traveled outside the U.S. on six different occasions.
 My travel experience has been limited to the U.S. I've been to many parts of the country, primarily for cheerleading competitions and family vacations, but haven't gotten to venture outside of our borders…yet.


 Preparation. Trying to guess what could be necessary in every situation is a disturbing situation.
 I've always worried about forgetting something really important like money, food or deodorant: yah know, the necessities.


 Soap. It is important to stay healthy on a venture like this. Other than food, sanitation is the key to health. If you are not feeling well, nothing else matters.
 A simple razor is important to me because I hate looking scruffy. However, I wouldn't get too far without a passport. I'm a clean-cut guy, so I have to have my ""beauty supplies.""


 I love to travel, and to go to these exotic places and do these activities to share with the world is unimaginable.
 The thrill of traveling to places unknown to me seems very intriguing, but also the chance to be an advocate for the gay community is something I've felt a calling to do, and to be in the public eye. I can hopefully be a good role model.


 Only domestic family vacations. It was enjoyable, but in no way comparable with this adventure.
 My dad and I have traveled together within the states, but I'm an international virgin, so I'm prepared to travel with an open mind.


 My biggest fear is holding up to the physical demands. Most of the competitors are much younger and fitter.
 My biggest fear, period, is sharks, so of course I'm nervous I'll be asked to swim with them or something of that nature. ""Jaws"" is one of my favorite movies, so yah see, Hollywood does warp your mind.


 Our strength is diversity. We are the only Team with a large age division. I bring experience and wisdom, but my age and physical condition could be a weakness.
 My greatest strength is my personality. I'm very nice and tend to get along with everyone in all walks of life, although I am very naive when it comes to international traveling. Plus I'm the youngest on the Race: I just recently turned 21.


 Andrew's strength is agility and charisma. There should be no physical challenge he can't complete, and he loves to interact with people. He never meets a stranger.
 Dad is very headstrong when it comes to traveling; he's ""been there, done that."" He does have problems with heights, so I hope that's not a factor that slows us down.


 I'll miss my wife and daughter most, of course, but beyond this, I truly miss cola drinks when I travel.
 What I'll miss the most is my friends and family. I have an awesome group of friends in Kentucky, and my mom, sister and brother are very cool. Plus, of course, I'll miss the guy I'm dating.


 None fluently.
 Very little Spanish. If that helps me in the Race I'll definitely have to call my high school Spanish teacher and thank her.


 Jerusalem; it is such a center for history. I have always dreamed of seeing sights such as the Temple Mount, Wailing Wall, Garden Tomb, etc.
 I've always wanted to go to Africa. I love the cultures there and the landscapes. I guess that's why my bedroom is very tribal, with leopard print and African masks.


 Germany, because I have done some travel there.
 Australia seems to be a lot like the U.S. as far as language and style, so I'd probably be best prepared for a country like ours since I haven't traveled internationally yet.[2]

Dennis & Erika,"


BioBefore the Race
Dennis & Erika met while they were in college at New York University. She was the Resident Assistant in charge of his floor, and it was completely against the rules for her to date the dorm residents. They found their way around this by booking a trip to Italy together, even though they barely knew each other. Their relationship progressed and they eventually got engaged, but Dennis broke off the engagement after Erika went skydiving naked. As Dennis describes it, ""I thought I was dreaming, but no, here comes my future wife floating through the air with nothing on but socks and sneakers and a naked instructor strapped to her back.""
Dennis & Erika's relationship has been through a lot. Six months after they started dating, Dennis saved Erika's life by pulling her free from a vicious dog attack. After that, Erika knew that she was in love.

In order to prepare for THE AMAZING RACE 5, Dennis & Erika worked out and trained by running in low-oxygen chambers. They say despite their broken engagement, they teamed up to do the Race ""to see if we could handle the pressure of high-stress, intense situations."" Erika says they are the perfect Team because ""we know how to play a cutthroat game fairly and ethically.""[1]

 We met at the Residence Life Lottery at NYU in early 1998. I was a Resident Assistant, and Dennis' friends were trying to convince him to live on my floor. He was refusing to live near the RA, but his roommates finally convinced him. After that, we began our very inappropriate Resident Assistant/resident romance.
 Opposites attract!
 We have traveled together to Italy, Greece and the French Polynesian Islands. The best part of traveling together is that we are both very adventurous and willing to try things that most of our other travel partners would never even attempt. New places allow us the opportunity to do activities and try new things that we wouldn't be able to try at home. The worst part of traveling together is our indecisiveness: we can never decide what to do next!
 We teamed up for the Race to test our relationship and see if we could handle the pressure of high-stress, intense situations.
 We're very uncertain of how the Race will affect our relationship. We feel certain it will either make us stronger or break us apart, but we're not sure if the Race will force us to be a team for life or convince us to go separate ways.


 I'm physically strong and well trained in running and biking. My weakness is that I can be too nice.
 I'm very good at getting in people's heads and figuring out what they are thinking. I can also be manipulative and have a win-at-all-costs mentality. My weakness is that I am overly dramatic and cry easily.


 Erika is very witty and is always able to think outside the box to come up with an idea that nobody else has thought about. Her weakness is that she is a complete and total drama queen who always has to get her way.
 Dennis' strength and weakness is one and the same. He is the most kind, genuine and honest person in the world, which makes him a bit naïve. His honest nature makes him trust people too easily, which is a detriment in this game.[2]

 I work for an e-commerce technology company based in Los Angeles and my role is in financial planning and analysis.
 Electrifying, practical and eager.
 Photography, cooking (I like to wing it in the kitchen and create my own flavors) and Isabelle Du.
 For an immigrant Cambodian kid, graduating from college and getting this far in my career is a huge accomplishment.
 Short Round from ""Indiana Jones."" I love a good adventure.
 Lucy Ricardo from ""I Love Lucy."" Isabelle is always up to something.
 Being robbed and stranded.
 Sounds strange, but I like airports and plane rides. And then when I get to my destination, it's trying the local food.
 The biggest challenge Isabelle and I face is the way we speak to one another. I may think she's copping attitude or yelling at me while she may think she's just talking normally and vice versa with me. This is where our communication wave breaks. We have been dealing with this since day one of our relationship and it could cause some serious issues on the Race.
 My biggest pet peeve with Isabelle is that she won't take initiative in helping around the house. I have to constantly ask her to pick up after herself or fold the laundry. And then she'll complain that I bug her too much.
 I would love to travel to Tokyo because of how busy the city can be. I would love to experience the Japanese cuisines. I just want to get lost in it all.
 I want to see the world with Isabelle! After this race hopefully we will know if we are ready to take our relationship to the next level.

 Model
 As a model, I've lived and worked abroad for four years in Thailand, Philippines, Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam. Some of my past work has included FHM, Elle, Cosmopolitan, Tresemme, Wet Seal and Mossimo.
 Adaptable, spontaneous and indecisive.
 Karaoking, ebaying and swimming.
 It was a dream come true to model abroad because I never got a chance to study abroad during college. When the opportunity came, I didn't think twice about it and jumped right in. I learned so much about myself by being on my own and away from everything I've ever known.
 I've never actually seen the show but Dennis always says that I remind him of Lucy from ""I Love Lucy.""
 Ross Geller from ""Friends.""
 For the most part, traveling doesn't scare me. If I could do one thing for the rest of my life, it would be to travel. However, I can admit that I'm slightly concerned that I won't know what the country's laws are and I'll get thrown into their jail for doing something that's so normal over here in the states. I should really reconsider watching episodes of ""Locked Up Abroad.""
 It's a guaranteed adventure. I can't stand being at home because everyone has the same mundane updates about their lives. I want to do things that only a rare handful can do. Once you're in a new environment, new experiences are to be had, and even the crazy ones make good stories later.
 Dennis likes to plan every little thing while I'm easygoing and carefree and will improvise things on a whim. He's not as spontaneous but he's open to the idea of it so long as I can convince him.
 He constantly reminds me about how I don't do anything around the house, but it's a work in progress and I'm really working on it!
 The Maldives is my #1 dream destination because every single photo I have seen of this place is heaven. I have to get there before it goes under water completely! And also, I can never say no to Vietnam. It's where my family is from, it's where I lived for four years and I have a very deep connection to it.
 My dream is to live all over the world. Not just traveling it, but LIVING all over it. And as unrealistic as that may sound to a lot of people, I know it's possible. I've had a taste of it and I want to live abroad again. I like having as few possessions as possible because I really think that's what weighs us down in life. Dennis has agreed that he'd be willing to go for it but sometimes I'm not sure if he's just saying that to appease me. He can be so calculative that I think it really holds him back from doing the ""carpe diem"" things in life. He doesn't even think we have that much stuff together while I think we have TOO much stuff. I want him to do ""The Amazing Race"" with me so he'll become more free-spirited and won't have to feel so calculated about living all over the world with me.

Derek & Claire,"[1]
Derek Xiao and Claire Rehfuss, reality romance from Los Angeles, California.
Derek, 24, is a product manager. Claire, 25, is an A.I. engineer. The pair first appeared on our screens last summer, albeit competing against each other on . Despite both losing the game, they found love in the jury house, and have been going strong now for nearly a year. This is Derek's third CBS reality show, having also just appeared on The Challenge: USA, and he hopes their chances of winning will finally not go down the latrine.

Derek & Drew,"
“”

BioQ & A
Thirty-two-year-old twins Derek and Drew can't recall the last time they got into a physical fight with each other. Except maybe that time in 1981, when they had it out in the back of their parents' Buick. The pair is originally from Chicago, but currently live in Los Angeles.
After graduating from the University of Illinois, Derek and Drew pursued careers in modeling and acting, and have appeared in commercials for Revlon and hosted shows on VH1 and E! While Drew is currently a photographer, Derek hopes to pursue his dream of becoming ""the next Michael J. Fox.""
Drew is still a bachelor, but Derek was married this past June. As a result, they haven't seen each other much lately, and Drew is hoping that this experience will give them the chance to reconnect. ""I couldn't come up with a better excuse to spend this much quality time with my brother,"" joked Drew.
Derek and Drew believe that the most important element to getting ahead in the Race is cleanliness. Drew is making sure he packs his toothpaste, toothbrush and dental floss, and says, ""It's nearly impossible to communicate effectively with bad breath."" Derek reveals that he won't leave home without his deodorant. ""I just hope to maintain a reasonable level of cleanliness and odor while on the race. Otherwise, it's almost impossible for people to deal with you,"" he says.
They may not be the Doublemint twins, but Derek and Drew will definitely be looking and smelling their best during their latest adventure. They're convinced that their strength, endurance and level-headedness will help them cross the finish line ahead of the pack.

Derek and Drew's birth date is August 30.[1]


 My travel experience has been fairly extensive. I have lived in Italy, Germany and England. I have also lived in New York, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles.
 I have traveled extensively inside the U.S. I have lived and worked in New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, and have driven everywhere in between. However, I haven't traveled internationally in seven years, and have only been to Europe.


 The most stressful aspect of traveling would be hygiene. I just hope to maintain a reasonable level of cleanliness and odor while on the Race. Otherwise, it is almost impossible for people to deal with you.
 Trying to smuggle on oversized carry-on baggage.


 The most important item in my backpack would have to be either deodorant or clean underwear (for reasons stated in my previous answer).
 It's a tossup between toothpaste, toothbrush, or dental floss. It's nearly impossible to communicate effectively with bad breath.


 I'm at a bit of a crossroads in my life, and this seems like an excellent way to discover new things about myself and what I am capable of. I also just got married, and this is probably the only time the rest of my life that I will get to spend this much time with my brother.
 I love the show, and I couldn't come up with a better excuse to spend this much quality time with my brother away from his wife after only two months of marriage. We haven't had a chance like this since he met his wife.


 Yes, a lot, and it has always been fun and relatively stress-free. However, we have never raced anywhere, and we are both very competitive, so I expect it will be very different on the show.
 Yes, we've traveled a lot together. It has almost always been very easy and fun. We haven't physically fought on a trip since the back seat of my parents' Buick in 1981.


 That somehow I am portrayed as someone other than the fun-loving, playful and intelligent male model that I am.
 The thing I fear most about competing in the Race is actually watching the Race. I hate the thought of watching myself on TV.


 My strengths are my ability to manage stress, both my own and my brother's, and my competitive spirit. My weaknesses are that I think I know everything and I don't trust anyone.
 My strengths would have to be my physical endurance and intuitiveness. My weaknesses are my ability to manage stress (yoga is something I used to do) and my inability to ask for help.


 My brother's strengths are his intelligence and his competitiveness: he does not lose. My brother's weaknesses are his ability to manage stress, and beautiful girls.
 Derek's strength is his level-headedness. He can be positive in any situation, and is always the voice of reason.

Don & Mary Jean,"


BioBefore the Race
Don & Mary Jean have been married for 20 years and live in Portola Valley, California. Between them they have six children and 16 grandchildren, all from previous marriages. They met almost 27 years ago through mutual friends while they were both married to other people. Donald is a physician, and Mary Jean is an interior designer.
Donald & Mary Jean live for adventure and travel. They have already traveled to six continents and believe that their combined travel experience will make them successful contenders in the Race. They are looking forward to all of the challenges that the Race may bring their way, especially the extreme tasks.
They have been through a lot together, including a near-death experience when their boat of eight people capsized in the South Pacific, throwing Donald onto a coral reef and Mary Jean into the water. The locals later told them that they held a memorial service for them, thinking that there was no way they could survive the treacherous water. The couple survived this horrific experience and emerged with a greater zest for life.
Before being selected for the Race, Mary Jean's most recent accomplishment is losing 23 pounds on Dr. Phil's diet, and Donald's is being an award-winning winemaker.

Although they are the oldest couple on this Race, Donald, 69, and Mary Jean, 65, believe that their life experience and appetite for adventure will be a key asset in winning THE AMAZING RACE.[2]


 Very extensive and to all six continents. Always exciting to be exposed to new and different cultures.
 When I'm traveling, I make every attempt to blend into the culture of the country I'm visiting. Why do I know that this will be impossible on the Race? Staying in bed-and-breakfasts or small hotels gives me the opportunity to spend time with and get to know the local people. Being surrounded by a bunch of other tourists is not my idea of how to experience another country. I'm partial to France and Italy, probably because I've spent more time there. I'm lucky to have had the opportunity to visit all of the continents.


 Lost baggage and documents.
 Mosquito bites.


 Primarily for the competition and the opportunity to interact with other countries and cultures and to prove that age should not be a factor in accepting challenges.
 As I sat at home and watched the Race on TV, I realized that I could compete as well as anyone else and, at age 65, if I didn't get out there now, I probably wouldn't have too many more opportunities. I like the idea of showing the world that even though I'm 65, it's possible to continue to face new challenges and to be open to new experiences. I've spent much of my life being limited by my fear of heights and know that I'll have to confront this on the Race. What an opportunity for adventure!


 In 27 years, we have traveled extensively on all six continents. It is always exciting and stimulating.
 Don and I share a love of travel and are fortunate to enjoy many of the same things. We travel very well together. I'm looking forward to when we'll have more time to travel. When we win the $1,000,000, maybe then he'll consider retiring and we can go play.


 A Race-ending injury.
 Looking like a raging bitch on TV. Don always comes across as the good guy, and I have a tendency to say pretty much whatever is on my mind.


Strengths are competitiveness, extensive travel experience, intellect and a ""never quit"" attitude. Weakness would only be perceived by others because of my age.
 I tend to be more analytical about the decisions I make and take more time to think things through. My biggest weakness is that often I don't have the courage to stand up for those decisions. I am also very impatient.


 My teammate brings the same attitude of competitiveness, a ""never quit"" attitude, and we have always traveled well as a couple. I perceive no weaknesses in my teammate other than insomnia when traveling.
 Don is physically very strong and will do whatever it takes to accomplish a task. His biggest weakness is that he is very stubborn (also a strength) and always wants to do things himself. He is also very impatient.


 My dogs.
 Make-up, lotion and my two Bichons.


 A little French, Italian and Spanish.
 A smattering of French, Italian, Spanish and German. Barely enough to get by in any of them.


 Nepal and Mongolia.
 I hope to visit countries that I haven't been to before, even though that would be a disadvantage on the Race. Any Third World country would be fascinating.


 France.
 Probably France, as I've spent the most time there, and French is my best second language.[3]

The more thoughtful and strategic of the two, Dustin describes herself as competitive, energetic and positive. She enjoys Ultimate Frisbee at the beach and body boarding with friends. 
Kandice, who was Miss New York 2005, is a Rockette at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. She describes herself as charismatic, determined and vivacious, and likes dancing, running and doing Pilates in her spare time. Kandice's free-spirited approach towards situations will be tested on the Race, where split-second decisions can be the difference between staying another day and putting away your passport. 

Despite their personality differences, these two women share one common characteristic that could prove costly for the other Teams: they are wildly competitive and determined to win at any cost. Their primary reason for competing on the Race is to see the world and share this experience with one another.[1]
These former Beauty Queens are back for a second chance and more determined than ever to prove to the world that they aren't just pretty faces. Proven to be fierce competitors during this current installment of Race, Dustin and Kandice are focused and have their sights on the Million Dollar Prize. These Best Friends met while rooming together at the Miss America pageant in 2005 and quickly formed a bond that they knew would last a long time. Dustin graduated Magna Cum Laude from California Baptist University with a BA in Speech Communications. She recently married her long-time sweetheart Luke. This Newlywed, who was crowned Miss California 2005, currently resides in Seattle, Washington and describes herself as thoughtful and spunky. Kandice, former Miss New York 2005, is a Rockette at Radio City Music Hall and in her senior year at New York University. She describes herself as charismatic, determined and vivacious and is positive that they can be the first all girl Team to win Amazing Race. These two women share one common characteristic that could prove costly for the other Teams on the Race: they are wildly competitive and more determined than ever to win at any cost. Will these beauties be able to prove to themselves and the world that they have what it takes to win the Million Dollar Prize?[2]

 I think the most important skill is paying attention to detail. Definitely reading all of the clues and keeping track of everything that way. Also keeping track of everything along the way.
 I agree 100% It's that kind of calm in the storm. You have to kind of regroup and just keep it together for a few seconds. Read the clue thoroughly and just be really detailed.

 Hmm…no one. [Laughs.]
 Not many mother/daughters that lasted in the race. But I love Rachel's energy. I don't know her last name, but I do love her energy. And we have that.
 [Simultaneously] We're not whiny! [Laughs.]
 But we definitely have that energy. She was always ready to go.
 Yeah she was ready to go and stop and do anything she had to do.
 She didn't care what she had to do.
 I mean she came top three in every final she's been on. So that's amazing in itself.

 Her trait that I do not possess is patience. [Laughs.]
 [Laughs.] Yes.
 I don't have the patience that she has.
 Which we're gonna work on together! [Laughs.] Thank you. A trait that she has that I do not possess is she is very aware of her surroundings. She's always looking up. She always knows what's going on. Sometimes I'm like…[Sings and looks off in the distance.] She's always very aware.

Neither Eric nor Lisa are afraid to challenge one another to be the best people they can be and no matter the challenge at hand, both are open to working together to find a solution. They hope that their experience on the Race will further solidify a marriage that they consider a true blessing.

 Cover celebrity and entertainment news and express my weirdness for the world to enjoy.
 Unpredictable, joyful and eccentric.
 Traveling, singing, cooking, public speaking and Instagram (duh).
 Being able to help build Clevver into one of the most viewed entertainment channels online! Being the first Lumbee Indian on The Amazing Race! And marrying THE MOST amazing man on the planet.
 Getting an incurable disease and also falling in love with a place that I will never want to leave! I am looking at you Ireland.
 Trying delicious new foods AND meeting our fans from all over the world who watch our shows!
 Our size. We're tough girls but we're worried about being able to beat guys who are taller and stronger!
 There are very few peeves, but she does drool a lot and she is THE MOST OVERLY POSITIVE PERSON EVER. But I also love that about her too.
 Africa. I want to visit an elephant rescue and hug and kiss elephants! And I would definitely cry... TEARS OF JOY... if that happened.
 Making memories with Joslyn that we can tell our kids about. Also, I want to push myself out of my comfort zone. I was raised as a pioneering country girl, and I need to get back to my roots!

 Executive Producer/Host/Influencer
 I executive produce and host (and oftentimes write) daily entertainment news and lifestyle/beauty content at Clevver, the number one entertainment news outlet on YouTube. We pull in approximately 150 million views every month!
 Compassionate, optimistic and gregarious. (And weird - that's a bonus)
 Travel (duh), going to concerts and anything adventurous and outdoors.
 Professionally, the accomplishment I'm most proud of is being at Clevver since day one, helping to build the company and the brand and taking our channels from zero to 3 plus billion views! Personally, I'm most proud of the fact that I'm responsible for naming a color for Crayola - it's called ""Tickle Me Pink."" I was 12. True story! HAHA! I think I need to accomplish something else...
 This is not a cop-out but there's really nothing that scares me about traveling. Sometimes what seems like the biggest set-back on a trip becomes the best adventure!
 In my career, I get paid to talk to and observe people, and that really what I'm passionate about. That said, it's not too surprising that when I'm traveling to a new place, I'm usually most excited by the local people - what they love, what they eat, how they interact, ALL of it!
 There's NO challenge we're afraid of (we're not absolutely NOT timid), but if I had to pick I'd say the biggest challenges we'll probably face will be physical. Don't get me wrong, we're in tip-top shape, but we know we don't have the same strength as some of the guy-guy teams.
 I love Erin, but the girl cries ALL THE TIME - when she's happy, when she's sad, when it's sunny, when something funny happens. I guess it's a pet peeve, but I also love that about her!
 I would LOVE to go anywhere in South America or Africa. As far as specific countries and cities go, I'm very open! Is going everywhere an option?
 I hope to have the time of my life on the Race and enjoy every single second! I realize this is an experience of a lifetime and I'm so grateful to be on the Race. But this is a RACE, so I also hope to kick some serious a$$ and hold it down for all the girls out there watching!

 I project manage new printing press installations for commercial and sheetfed printers in North America. I bring the sold contract to life by integrating project team members from design, manufacturing and installation, all while being the single point of contact for my customer.
 I frequently delegate tasks and have the ability to optimize work by utilizing a person's skill sets. The majority of my job is dealing with time-critical, problem-solving tasks that require urgent responses and decisions.
 Loyal, comical and energetic.
 Traveling, no glove 16"" softball, graphic design and origami.

 I moved to Germany by myself and lived for a year without ever traveling outside of the U.S. prior and without having any knowledge of the local language. I even joined a German baseball team and made some lifelong friendships.
 Lawless regions where foreigners are not highly regarded. 
 Interacting with people and cultures different from my own. Also, getting to experience different sights, smells and tastes that you cannot reproduce outside of the specific country. 
 I have a roundabout way of explaining my point and my direction can be vague.
 Planning – Cindy loves to plan every aspect of our lives and sometimes it can be overwhelming.
 DPRK/North Korea because so much is unknown about it. I've seen videos of the LAS5 AriRang, which is a great gymnastics and performance display by more than 100,000 North Koreans. I feel this would be an incredible culture shock that I want to see and understand.
 I want to share this once in a lifetime experience of The Race with my fiancé. If we do win, we will have a nice footing to start our social business venture that will be intertwined with the needs that we see around the world.

 I lead a cross-functional brand team. This includes everything from brand strategy, new products, team development, financial management to sales and marketing.
 Through my corporate job, I have been faced with challenging adversity, taking calculated risks and making quick informed decisions. My job is also highly competitive and you must have a strong desire to win with solid performance. All of these skills are vital to winning The Race and I'm confident I can bring it to win it.
 Determined, dedicated and passionate.
 Exercising, cooking, and planning. I like to plan anything and everything.
 I'm told that I'm a replica of Lucy Liu, but I would like to be similar to Lauren Conrad from ""The Hills."" She is very entrepreneurial, highly accomplished, likeable and friendly.
 Zach Morris from ""Saved By The Bell."" Ernie loves to be the center of the action and he's a big jokester.
 I was crowned Homecoming Queen at my undergraduate university.
 Lack of control – I'm gluten-free and it can often be a challenge to find suitable foods in new locations, especially places where there's a language barrier.
 I love meeting local people and understanding more about their culture and daily rituals. I find it fascinating that we are all humans, but have very different ways of living a happy life.
 Ernie needs to be more direct with me. He is so easy going that he goes along with what I want, but I don't know if that's really what he wants.
 He's a really happy-go-lucky person with a positive attitude and outlook on life, but for some crazy reason he always gives me some round-about answer to any of my questions.
 India! I love the rich culture and history of India. I would love to see the Taj Mahal, explore the 'triangle' and see the white sandy beaches of Goa.
 I hope we will learn a lot about each other through this process. Our goal is to become entrepreneurs together and The Race will give us a solid opportunity to test our working relationship and see if we can actually work together.

Erwin & Godwin are super competitive brothers from San Francisco, California. Although they are both overachievers, Godwin feels that he grew up in the shadow of his ""perfect"" Harvard-educated older brother. He believes the Race will provide a great opportunity for him to showcase his talents and prove that he is as capable as Erwin.
Erwin, a manager for an insurance company, describes himself as being calm, confident and creative. He claims the most exciting moment of his life was his first plane ride ""when the world just opened up,"" and he's been traveling ever since. Godwin, a financial analyst, is the more ambitious of the two and is not afraid to take risks.
The brothers enjoy working out together and discussing new business ideas. Both men are well-traveled and enjoy the excitement that comes with visiting new places. The siblings are thrilled to have the chance to travel the globe, compete for a million dollars and do some brotherly bonding along the way.[1]

 Getting to be on ! I've had a dream to be on this show since I was eight years old. My brother and I grew up watching Race with our family. We were two Indian-American kids who didn't often see people like us on American reality TV shows. I remember when the race went to Chennai, India (our hometown) in Season 10, we were jumping up and down in our little living room because we were so excited to see The Amazing Race bring our culture to a mainstream American audience. I remember telling my dad that day, ""I'm going to be on The Amazing Race when I'm older."" I'm proud of myself for not just letting it be a pipe dream, but actually going to an open casting call, trying out, and making my childhood dream a reality!
 Being lost alone. Even in 2020, traveling alone as a woman requires some precautions.

 Making a childhood dream a reality is sweet, but getting to do that with your sibling is the cherry on top. I'm excited to spend more time with my brother! As we've gotten older, we don't see each other as often as I'd like to. He's a big blessing in my life and I'm excited to go on this adventure with him.

 Brinkley, Ark. / New Orleans
 Harlem Globetrotters
 Teammates
Their athletic talent brought these two friends together five years ago when they met at the Harlem Globetrotters training camp. While getting to know each other, Herbert and Nathaniel discovered that their occupation and need to entertain others were not the only things they had in common.  They both live in Louisiana, have two children and shared the same college basketball coach.
Recently, Herb and Nate lost one of their best friends and teammate, Chris Richardson, who passed away in December — and both continue to struggle with that loss.  The three were commonly referred to as the ""three amigos"" throughout their inner circle.
Herbert believes he can get along with anyone on the planet and that he brings joy and laughter to all corners of the globe. Standing at 6'3,"" Herb is known among his colleagues as ""Flight Time.""  Nathaniel, who goes by the name ""The Big Easy,"" towers over the competition at 6'9,"" and admits to being worried that seating could present a problem on some of the flights.
Both have traveled extensively with the Globetrotters. Herbert has traveled to over 60 countries, and Nathaniel has traveled to over 30 countries. Despite their love of exploring new places, and their extensive knowledge of other countries, they're eager to see how well they can travel together when it is just the two of them.  

Even if their fancy footwork does not translate to winning the $1 million prize, they both are confident that their relationship will remain the same regardless of where they end up in the Race.[1]

Flo & Zach,"

BioQ & A
New Yorkers Flo, 23, a public relations associate, and Zach, 23, a production assistant, have been good friends ever since they met five years ago in a cafeteria at Vassar College. While wearing a funny hat and a camouflage suit, Zach instantly caught Flo's eye. Although Flo and Zach have shared a mutual attraction for each other over the years, they've never pursued a romantic relationship.
One of their most memorable times together was when they were both bartending in college. Says Flo, ""We would go crazy making drinks for the whole bar, trying to be Tom Cruise in Cocktail. It was so fun to be silly with someone while working."" Ironically, one of the worst experiences they've ever had took place while they were working together. When a young girl became extremely ill from drinking too much, Flo and Zach had to rush her to the hospital. ""We had to deal with the EMS and it was a really scary situation,"" says Zach, who adds, ""It was reassuring to go through it with Flo.""
Although Flo and Zach are seasoned travelers, the couple has only shared one 24-hour trip together. This Team is convinced, however, that they have what it takes to come out on top. According to Zach, ""I am the logistics man. I'm good with directions, roughing it and keeping a cool head. Flo is very good at keeping things fun. She's also great at getting people to do things they might not otherwise do."" Flo and Zach are looking forward to seeing some great places during the Race, and hope the experience will bring them even closer together.

Flo's birth date is January 17. Zach's birth date is June 29.[1]


 Pretty extensive.
 I have traveled extensively in Europe (east and west), and have been to many other countries in South America. I've never been to Asia.


 Missing flights and getting stuck in traffic.
 After a while, I find it stressful to be on the move. But in general, I find travel to be very relaxing.


 My sunscreen—and my Tylenol—migraines and a sunburn would surely slow me down.
 Probably my two pairs of super high-tech underwear. They dry in seconds and make you run faster—very funny stuff.


 To see great places and to win some money.
 I wanted to be on THE AMAZING RACE to have the adventure of a lifetime and win a million bucks in the process.


 We've never traveled together before, except one 24-hour drive to Boston.
 Not really. One time we took a marathon, one-day trip from New York to Boston. It was rugged, but good training, I hope.


 No fears.
 My biggest fear of competing in THE AMAZING RACE 3 is probably getting lost in a jungle or desert. Either that, or losing in the first leg of the Race. But that won't happen.


 I am a great traveler. I get along well with others. I am also very competitive. The only weakness is that I love to go to sleep early, and often fall asleep in random places. I've also never really roughed it.
 I am the logistics man. I am good with directions, orienteering, roughing it and keeping a cool head. One of my weaknesses is that I am not as competitive as Flo.


 Zach is brilliant. He is really prepared and has great endurance. Also, he is not afraid to wear one pair of underwear the whole trip. His weakness: not competitive enough.
 Flo is very good at keeping things fun. She is also great at getting people to do things they might not otherwise do. But, she can't really drive stick and doesn't have much experience roughing it.


 My family.
 I'll miss my friends at home, the wolfpack, and my family.

Barry & Fran have known each other for 45 years and have been married for over 40. The proud parents of two children, this adventure-loving couple makes their home in Summit County, Colorado. Although they travel a lot, the word ""vacation"" is not a frequently used term in their home. They prefer to refer to their trips around the world as ""adventure travel.""
Barry, who is 63 years old, thrives on challenging himself and loves to compete. A retired urologist and former battalion surgeon with the 173rd Airborne Brigade in Vietnam, Barry describes himself as outgoing and dependable. His biggest disappointment with regards to Fran was that she refused to bungee jump from a bridge in New Zealand. Although he does point out that she made good by agreeing to skydive.
Fran, who is 61 years old, is a retired accountant who describes herself as having a positive outlook on life. Fran enjoys skiing, biking, and hiking and has climbed all of Colorado's 54 14ers, which are the Colorado mountain peaks that exceed 14,000 feet. Fran admits that she's running THE AMAZING RACE to show that ""old people"" can compete just as well as most 25 year olds.

Although they've been separated for a year, they're considering getting back together, and see THE AMAZING RACE as an opportunity to find out how well they can work together.

Freddy & Kendra,"


BioBefore the Race
Freddy & Kendra are an engaged couple from Miami, Florida. They met over two years ago when they were booked together on a modeling job. At the time, Kendra lived in New York City, but six weeks later, she moved back to Miami, and they've been together ever since.
They say they share a deep mutual love and respect for one another, even though Kendra describes herself as organized and prepared and describes Freddy as someone who ""wings it"" with brute force. Both of them have lived in several parts of the world, including Paris, Milan, Barcelona and New York City.

Their primary motivation for doing THE AMAZING RACE is for the money, but also to have the chance to be involved in crazy adventures and travels that they would never be able to arrange or afford on their own.[2]


 I have traveled extensively around Europe, America, Asia and many islands.
 I have traveled extensively around Europe, America, South America and many islands. I have lived in Milan and Barcelona as well as NYC, and currently Miami. I travel very frequently with my job.


 The most stressful part is language barriers (especially in Asia) and an inability to sleep on airplanes, buses or trains.
 The most stressful aspect is not having comforts from home.


 I want to travel with my L.O.L.A. and experience great adventures. Plus, I love competition.
 I want to be on TAR so that I can travel with my fiancé and experience wild adventures that we probably wouldn't get a chance to do otherwise. I feel as though I have a few ""adventure oats"" to sow before completely settling down into a marriage and family. I would also like to prove that the typical model stereotype (not wanting to get down and dirty, primping, whining, first-class service, etc.) will not stand in our way of winning. I am a very feminine girl, but that does not mean I won't do everything it will take to win this Race. Regardless, if I like it or not, I'm ready to push through any challenge they throw at me. Our motto is ""never give up at any cost,"" no matter how much physical, emotional or mental pain we are in.


 Kendra and I have traveled to the Caribbean islands, Europe and through the U.S. We enjoyed it thoroughly.
 Freddy and I have traveled with each other before. We have always had a spectacular time together. We've traveled around the US, lived in Barcelona for a few months and voyaged around Europe a bit. We have been booked together on several jobs in the Caribbean islands and had a blast.


 Lack of good food. If I don't eat, I'm not happy.
 Coming in 2nd place and no adequate sleep I fear the most in the Race! Well, okay, being eliminated first is, of course, a given. Ouch! That would really be a kick in the teeth.


 Strengths: I have a good sense of direction; I'm athletic, physically strong and well traveled. Weaknesses: I have a lack of attention to detail.
 My weaknesses are that I really require a lot of sleep (minimum of at least nine hours a night) to feel normal and perform my best, and I have to eat like an infant—every 2 to 3 hours—or I can become a bit cranky. Sad but true. I guess I am in for a big rude awakening. My strengths are that I love to laugh. I love adventure. I am intelligent, athletic, organized and detail-oriented. I am good with directions, and I am well traveled. I am charming and get along really well with most everyone. I'm a great people person.


 Strengths: Damn, she's hot. She really is beautiful. Also organized, pays attention to detail, and she will definitely surprise people at times. Weaknesses: She requires a lot of sleep and must have fooood. She gets very irritable when she's hungry and when PMSing.
 Freddy's strengths are that he is athletic, strong willed, very competitive, well traveled, and great with directions (he's a pilot). He loves new adventures and has no specific fears (maybe snakes a little: sssssssss). Freddy will keep me comfortable and happy throughout the Race. He is definitely a gentleman and thinks of me before himself. His weaknesses are that he sometimes gets in a zone when focusing on something and can be completely oblivious to things around him, i.e. me talking to him. He gets very cranky when not fed properly, and he is not detail-oriented. He doesn't like to thoroughly read through directions; he would rather skim and wing it than deal with the details.

 I will miss our dog, Baylee, the most from home.

 I speak English, Spanglish and a little honky-tonk.

 I am hoping to visit Malaysia, Thailand or Indonesia (though not Bali. We are saving that one for our honeymoon).

 I feel best prepared for Italy or Spain.[3]

The Gaghan family, from Glastonbury, Connecticut consists of Bill, 40, Tammy, 42 and their children, Billy, 12 and Carissa, 9.
Bill works in jet-engine sales and admits his biggest pet peeve about himself is his lack of patience. Bill is hoping the Race will show his family the importance of working together as a team and the benefits of never giving up.
Tammy is a substitute teacher for her local school district. Having lived in Korea for over three years, Tammy and Bill have traveled extensively. Both compete in marathons across the country and are planning to run one in each state.
Billy is entering seventh grade and describes himself as outgoing and adventurous. His mother says he's currently going through typical pre-teen mood swings and hopes that this won't interfere with his ability to focus on the Race. Billy's favorite activities are football and running. He intends to show his dad that he has what it takes to compete in the Race.
Carissa, who will be in the fourth grade, is playful and silly. While she is one of the younger Racers, her dad feels her keen eyes and fighting spirit will make up for her small size. She enjoys running with her dog, Blaze, and playing soccer. Carissa wants to show her parents that she is a tough competitor ready to take on the adults in the race.
The Gaghan family has traveled around the world and are hoping those experiences have prepared them for this competition.[2]

 Santa Cruz, Calif. / San Francisco, Calif.
 Engineer/Editor
 Dating On and Off
One word to describe this team is passionate. Garrett and Jessica met in Barcelona, Spain while on a yearlong study abroad program and have been dating on and off for seven years—during which time they've had three major breakups. Their fiercely independent natures have kept them from making any real commitment. Both are the oldest children in their families and thrive on being in control and competitive. However, one thing they both agree on is their love for travel—they have been to over 50 countries.
Garrett is certain his engineering background—including a master's degree in engineering from Stanford University—will come in handy on the Race, specifically the ability to assess and analyze complex situations on the fly. He describes himself as confident, hardworking and adventurous. Surfing is his favorite hobby.
Jessica, who describes herself as loyal and spirited, is a travel and lifestyle editor accustomed to being a creative, quick thinker, which will definitely be useful on the Race. Coming from a large Colombian family, Jessica has learned the importance of teamwork. She enjoys photography and being physically and mentally challenged. One of her proudest accomplishments was climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania (19,340').
Garrett and Jessica believe that this experience may be the final make or break moment in their relationship.[1]

Gary & Dave,"
“”Bio[]Writers Gary and Dave met during a job interview. According to Gary, ""It was a chilly winter in Chicago about five years ago. We hung out drinking beers. We didn't like each other then, and we don't now."" The two once went on a cross-country road trip together, and Gary claims that they ""couldn't go three turn-offs without getting into a fight. The best part of traveling together is always having someone to yell at, but that's the worst part too."" Dave's version is slightly different: ""Worst aspect--Gary consistently getting us lost. Best aspect--my sense of direction.""
Gary and Dave decided to team up for THE AMAZING RACE because they ""were running out of unemployment checks in NYC and needed to find a new racket."" When pondering how THE AMAZING RACE might affect their relationship, Dave says, ""Well, I figure it couldn't get any weaker."" Gary agrees: ""We figure the relationship won't get any more strained…. If anything, we figure it will have to strengthen it.""

Gary[]
 53
 Morganfield, Ky.
 Father
 Entrepreneur
Triathlon, scuba diving and hunting/fishing
 Building a company from the ground up with my family to become one of the largest in the industry; getting my commercial pilots license and logging over 5000 hours; and, I wrestled and coached for University of Central Missouri and Union County High School.
 Be a better husband, father and friend
 Being out of the country if something were to happen to my family
 Learning about different people and cultures
 No one - I'm not perfect, but I'm happy with who I am.
 My parents - I still strive to make them proud of me.
 My family, work, faith and fitness
 If I were to win the million dollars I would help as many people with it as I could.
 I ran 13 marathons and a half Ironman triathlon after I turned 45. 
 Ngoro Ngoro crater in Tanzania
 The biggest obstacle of running the Race will be living up to our family's expectation that we are going to win.
 I would like to win for my family and community. I hope to represent both well so that they will be proud of my effort.
 My daughter has a stubborn streak—a lot like me.

Mallory[]

 Lexington, Ky.
 Daughter
 Miss Kentucky 2009
 Performing, spending time with my family on our farm and thrill seeking activities like skydiving and bungee jumping
 I was very proud of being selected as 4th runner up at Miss America. It was something that I have worked and prepared for my entire life.
 Perform on Broadway! I also love motivational speaking and would love to find a way to continue this throughout my life. Lastly, I want to make my family proud.
 Being out of the country if something was to happen to my family
 I love diving blindly into new cultures and cities - the food, the language and the general attitude toward life. I also love that feeling that I have when I return home and realize all the good things that I have right here.
 Phil, because he gets to do  every season. 
 My dad
 My family, singing and helping others find joy in life
 I would give some of it to the organizations that helped me along my way to achieve my dreams—the Miss America and Miss Kentucky Organization, Autism Awareness as well as the Catholic grade school and public high school I attended. I would save or invest the rest. My father will probably disagree.
 I've already made a million dollars - for charity. When I was Miss Kentucky I sold a country ham for 1.3 million dollars and all the money went to local charities in my state.
 Rome, Italy
 We're both very stubborn so we will have to learn how to give a little. We also need to work on trusting each other.
 I hope to have the adventure of a lifetime and an experience to share with my Dad. He is a huge fan and has never missed an episode. It would mean a lot to him to be able to run the Race together.

 Biggest pet peeve about my dad is that he never thinks about himself.

 Season 17/6th Place
 Getting lost in Oman.
 It was very memorable getting second three legs in a row. It was nice in Norway and Sweden because we had a comfortable lead and could relax a little and look around.
 St. Petersburg, Russia. It was a beautiful city with great people. Plus, it wasn't 100 degrees outside.
 All of the same reasons as before except we want to win this time.
 I'm better prepared physically and mentally.
 My family, my work, my faith, fitness and now, The Amazing Race!
 I ran 13 marathons and a half Ironman triathlon after I turned 45.
 Australia, I've never been and I like the spirit of the people that I have met from there.
 To relax and enjoy the moment and not miss the beauty of what we are running through.
 Meet new people, see new places and be the last team standing.
 She talks too much.
 Give it away.
 Let Mallory drive more. She is a more aggressive driver and I am a better navigator. We are also only going to bring one backpack with less than twenty pounds for both of us.

 Season 17/6th place
 Not turning around earlier in Oman.
 Finishing the bicycle rim challenge in Ghana and moving from last place to second place.
 I loved the Arctic Circle, especially the first half in Sweden. We were so hot and tired after racing two legs in Ghana, so the weather was perfect. I loved the snow.
 I want to continue what we started last season and make it to the end. I also want to be the first parent-child team to win.
 It hasn't been that long, but my occupation has changed. I was the reigning Miss Kentucky during the last race, but my year of service has ended so things aren't as crazy and hectic this time. I am able to focus more on the Race and I've grown even more excited about it this time.
 Performing, my family, my faith and striving to be a positive role model.
 Australia! I've never been, but I know I would love it there. I think my dad and I would fit right in with the people there.
 To enjoy it more than we did last time. That will be a challenge because we loved it so much. We also need to work on our patience with each other.
 I hope to see my dad standing proud and fulfilled at the finish line.
 My dad is laid back and moves a little slower than me. My pet peeve is when he takes a long time to get his thoughts out and I'm already onto the next thing.
 I would give some of it to the Catholic school that I attended growing up. I would use the rest of the money to begin my life and career.

 I need to let my dad navigate more. He's definitely better at that. We also need to remember how strong we are.

 Laurel, Mont. / Bozeman, Mont.
 Construction Manager and Mortgage Broker/ Student
 Father/Son
Gary is a PC, Matt is a Mac. Gary enjoys hunting, Matt enjoys video games. Gary enjoys classic rock, Matt enjoys metal. This father and son duo do not have a lot in common and they never have … that is why they are running the Race. They are eager to share the experience of a lifetime with one another and establish a bond for the rest of their lives.
Despite their many differences, these two share a bond in their common sense approach to problem solving, which at times, has been said to be uncanny.
Gary is hoping Matt will open up to him during the Race, as they will be forced to spend all of their time together — a first for each of them. Matt is hoping that his dad will learn to listen to him and attempt to understand his point of view.
Matt was almost killed when he was hit by a car and broke his leg so badly that he had to have a metal rod put in to hold it in place. It has since been removed and he is back in great shape and ready to race. Matt describes himself as creative, trustworthy and a peacemaker, while Gary describes himself as decisive, direct and competitive.
They see this as a great opportunity for them to see the world and spend quality time together, while hopefully winning the Race and a million dollars along the way.[1]

Gina & Sylvia,"
“”

BioQ & A
Gina and Sylvia are two 30-something stay-at-home moms from Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, who are constantly on the go. Whether it's changing diapers, helping with homework or cheering on a little one at a soccer game, the pair have been busily taking care of their families and haven't had much time to focus on themselves.
While both moms attended the University of South Carolina, they met and became friends at a baby shower. Instead of pursuing careers outside of their home, they both decided to become at-home moms, and they've been close ever since. As Gina and Sylvia experience the joys and frustrations of motherhood, their children, whose ages range from 16 months to 9 years, have already shared many memorable moments together.
THE AMAZING RACE gives ""Team Soccer Mom"" the chance to experience an adventure away from their families before they head back to the chaos of daily life. ""Our lives revolve around kids, carpools, diapers, cleaning bathrooms, laundry, etc.,"" says Gina. ""I personally have had very little opportunity to travel. Everything I do on a daily basis is about my family, I want to do this trip for me.""
Sylvia agrees. ""I want to do something for me. I love taking care of my children but it's a job that requires one to devote themselves totally to someone else."" She adds, ""I'm also doing it for my daughter. I want her to see me do something special. I don't want her to think that all I did was sit at home!""
While they're on the road, both Gina and Sylvia have photos of their families with them so they can keep them close to their hearts during the tough days that lie ahead. With their easy-going, Southern nature, they think they have the charm and sensibility to come out on top. Plus, to them, the challenge is nothing compared to being a mom with a hectic family schedule.

Sylvia has three children, Charlie, Allison and Henry. Her birth date is January 17. Gina is mother of two children, Hunter and Abigil. Her birth date is September 23.[1]


 I personally have had very little travel experience. The Caribbean and a handful of states. That's one of the reasons I'm so excited about this trip.
 I haven't done much traveling as an adult. As a child, I traveled with my mom to Peru (she is from Peru). But the older we got (my siblings and I), we didn't travel with her; she went alone. After I was married, my husband and I went to England.


 The most stressful aspect of traveling, I think, will be the language barriers. It's going to be frustrating and scary at times, being unsure of where you're going and unable to communicate. That is a vulnerable position to be in.
 On this Race, the most stressful aspect of traveling has to be our limited resources. We can't just check into a hotel or whip out a credit card and get out of town, or hop on a plane. Not to mention the language barrier!


 I packed two pictures of my husband and children. They are my inspiration. I really want them to be proud of me.
 I'm carrying a photograph of my husband and our three children. They are my inspiration. They are the reasons for most everything I do.


 I got married at 23, right out of college. My husband and two children are my life. I love them more than anything and wouldn't change a thing, but I want to do this Race for me. Everything I do on a daily basis is about someone else. I need to prove to myself I can do this.
 My world is filled with my children and my husband, and I'm really happy with that. This is something that I'm doing for myself, because I want to. I wanted to show my children that they, too, can do anything they want in life, that their world doesn't have to have limitations.


 All of our previous travel experiences consist of--you guessed it--vacations with the kids. We load up the minivan and take our five children anywhere family-oriented and driveable. It is very chaotic at times, but we're hopefully making great memories for the kids.
 We've taken short trips. We've never traveled outside the country. I have a minivan that will fit the two of us and our children, so our trips have always been short and fun and within driving distance.


 My fear would be to be presented with a challenge I may not be successful at, therefore letting down my Team. What I really hope to discover about myself is not my fears, but that I am stronger mentally and physically than I ever gave myself credit for.
 I think I fear letting my partner down, and myself. I want to push myself emotionally and physically. I believe I can do it. I don't want to disappoint myself or Gina. So, I guess I'm fearful of my own limitations, and finding out what scares me, or what pushes my buttons.


 Physically, I am not as strong as Sylvia. I also think I tend to get impatient. My strengths lie in the thinking clearly and studying the angles in the decision-making process.
 I think I can be strong physically. I tend to be more of the risk-taker. I communicate well. I think my weakness is that I can be more emotional. I sometimes have a short fuse.


 Physically, Sylvia is definitely the stronger of the two of us. She also can talk the two of us in and out of anywhere we need to go. She is funny and charming. People love her! Her weakness would have to be not paying attention to the details. We balance each other well; we let each other lead where they are strongest.
 Gina brings rational thinking to our Team. She's a great problem-solver. She's smart. She's strong. She's a great leader. We balance each other well. I tend to be stronger, physically. That is mostly just because of her size.


 What I will miss more than anything is not material; it is people: my husband and children. Everything else seems relatively unimportant. It's only a month. You can do anything for 30 days.
 I will miss my three children and my husband most of all. I believe I will learn to appreciate my house, my van, my backyard, etc. I think we all take for granted the simple things that as Americans we have. Living in our country is truly a privilege.


 Only English and a few Spanish words.
 English and about ten Spanish words!


 I would love to go to Greece or Italy.
 I would love to go to Peru, specifically Machu Pichu. My mother is from Peru, and I have family there. I want to see this magical place that I have roots in. I haven't been to Peru since I was a small child. I have just some vague memories.


 I really don't feel more prepared for any one particular place. Obviously the English-speaking countries will be easier to get around. I'm just going to take each destination as it comes and give it my best.
 None! I haven't traveled the world. This is going to be a great adventure, and one that I'll never forget![2]

Glenda, 41, is an insurance underwriter. Lumumba, also 41, is a middle school teacher. This couple has only known each other for two and a half years, having been married for one. But they're ready to take on problems of any size on the race, which may work to their advantage considering the seven inches of height discrepancy between them.
"
Godlewski Family,"
The Godlewski family is a team of sisters from Des Plaines, Illinois. The four siblings, from oldest to youngest, are Michelle, Sharon, Christine and Tricia. Each sister has her own personality, which might cause some roadblocks of their own along the way.
Michelle, 42, is the most direct of the group. She describes herself as excitable and competitive.
Sharon, 39, works as an insurance claim consultant. She says she's alluring and personable and admits that she thrives on challenges.
Christine, 37, is a bit obsessive. A homemaker and the mother of four, Christine's biggest pet peeve about herself is not being able to defend herself when she gets into an argument with her siblings.
Tricia, the youngest at 26, is always forced to play the role of peacemaker. Tricia is hoping to show her big sisters that she has what it takes to endure THE AMAZING RACE.
All four sisters live within 30 minutes of one another. Although they have traveled extensively together, the Race will surely put their relationships to the test as they embark on a much different kind of family vacation.[2]

 Read the directions. Read the freaking directions.
 Yeah, attention to detail.
 That's a better one, just all-encompassing. And that's both for navigational directions as well as task directions.
 You got to have it. If you can iron out every single detail along the way, then you're going to be smooth sailing. That's why you iron, to make things smooth!
 You could walk this race if you did everything by the tee compared to people who sprint and go the wrong way.

 There's a first for everything!
 [Laughs.] We would be unique.
 The Franklins, we're one in a million.
 But if we had to, I think maybe the military brothers. One, just because they're African American as well. And two, just the dynamic. They have strength and speed and intelligence, kind of a little bit of intensity as well.
 We are not vets, just to make that clear.
 [Laughs.] We are not vets.
 Very opposite of vets, yeah. [Laughs.]

 Gregory's really bold. He will make that leap; he will eat that thing. And I will sometimes get in my head about it. I'll need to take my time, give myself a countdown. I give Gregory all the trust in the world to just ""3, 2, 1, do it,"" and I wish I could do that.
 On the flip side, Johnny's very good at making decisions and having a calculated way to make decisions. I very much just choose. If I think it's a good decision, I'm just gonna go for it. Johnny will sit and think about the decision before he makes it.
 Sometimes that leads to indecisiveness, which you don't need.
 But sometimes it leads to making the correct decision instead of just going for the one that feels right.

Gus & Hera,"


BioBefore the Race
Gus & Hera are a father and daughter from and Gaithersburg, Maryland and Los Angeles, California, respectively. Gus is a former CIA agent, covert operative and the first person to fly an open-cockpit plane to the North Pole. Hera is a special education teacher and holds a Masters degree in special education with a cross-cultural emphasis.
Gus & Hera describe themselves as intelligent and resourceful, but also as aggressive and headstrong, and they often butt heads. Gus says Hera can be extremely stubborn, but he sees that as an extension of his own personality.
While Hera says the money is her prime motivation for doing THE AMAZING RACE, Gus says that having this experience with his child will help him relate to her as an adult and see how he did as a parent.

[1]


 I am a seasoned world traveler with lots of experience.
 I have traveled to a few places in Europe and all over the Caribbean and Middle America. I also lived in South Africa for half a year and traveled around southern Africa for a little while.


 Getting enough sleep.
 I think language barriers can be really stressful. I can remember when I was in France on a family vacation, and as soon as we got off the plane, my dad started speaking English in a French accent as if that would help. Ha ha.


 I wanted to take the time to be with my daughter.
 I wanted to be on THE AMAZING RACE because I love adventure, and I think my father and I needed bonding time because we really have never had a common goal that could bring us together. The Race presented itself as a chance to really test our relationship and, for me, to show my father—and many other people in my life—how strong I am.


 Hera is my little girl. We have traveled together many times as a family, but never together alone. Hera can be very stubborn, but so can I.
 Yes, we have traveled a lot together. My father and I travel very differently! He doesn't mind eating at gas stations and not ever stopping to pee, and I am really picky about my food and have to pee a lot. I also have issues with not getting enough sleep. He has issues waking up early.


 My biggest fear is that we will be the first Team eliminated.
 My biggest fear is disappointing my family, my friends and my students. I want people to see me as the strong, intelligent black woman that I am, not ""the black bitch."" I want my father to be proud of the daughter he raised. I want my mother to smile, knowing that she was and is my rock and I am a reflection of how she raised me.


 My strength will be that I will always be calm and deliberate. My weakness will be that I will always be calm and deliberate.
 My strength is that I am stubborn, determined and athletic. There are a lot of strengths that my father and I share, but sometimes I can bring determination when the mood is down.


 Hera has a good mind and can react to a situation as need be. Her weakness is that she can let her emotions get the better of her.
 My dad is one of the most intelligent people I know. He is also really good at reading people. When I am emotional, he has the ability to stay focused and not let his emotions rule him.


 I will miss my wife most on this trip.
 I get really cold easily! I think I will miss being able to put on clean, warm clothes. I will also miss talking to my mother, because not a day goes by that we don't talk.


 I speak English and some German.
 I speak English, and I try to speak French on occasion!


 I'm looking forward to wherever we go. I'm getting to see how my little girl has grown and getting a chance to meet the woman she has become.
 I am partial to the continent of Africa, so if you see me anywhere in Africa, I will probably be happy!


 I feel we will do best in Europe.
 I am not sure I can say I would be best prepared for anywhere! I think I could probably do pretty well in South Africa because I lived there, but anywhere else is fair game. I can get lost in my backyard if the activity warranted.[2]

Hayden & Aaron,"


BioBefore the Race
Hayden & Aaron live together in Los Angeles, California. About eight months ago, they saw each other for the first time at a Mexican restaurant. They describe this encounter as fate and love at first sight. Aaron chased Hayden down in the parking lot in hopes of not leaving without asking for a date. Their first date was the next day, and they have been inseparable ever since.
Although they have known each other for only a few months, they feel like they are soulmates and share a lot in common, such as competitiveness, athleticism, sensitivity and, most importantly, closeness with their respective families. However, their personalities differ, as Hayden is more direct and loud while Aaron is more laid back.
They both come from athletic backgrounds. Hayden received a track scholarship to the University of New Mexico, and Aaron was All-American for volleyball at Michigan State University. Their natural ambition and competitiveness is not only their primary reason for going on the Race, it is one of the reasons they think that they are going to win.

Hayden & Aaron are both models and are trying to pursue acting careers in Los Angeles. They feel that THE AMAZING RACE will bring them closer together as a couple and maybe help take their relationship to the next level.[1]


 My travel has been limited to the entire United States, Mexico and Canada. I have had other opportunities to go to Europe, New Zealand and Australia, but because of my fear of flying, I wouldn't go.
 My previous travel experience has been limited to the US, Canada and Mexico. But I've been on cross-country road trips several times with my friends and Hayden. I love to travel and can't wait for the Race.


 To me, the most stressful aspect is the flying.
 For me, the most stressful part of traveling is when I don't have control of the situation, like a delayed flight or an incompetent cab driver.


 I wanted to be on the Race to explore places that I have never been and to test my own personal limits. I want to overcome personal fears and to see how Aaron and I do in stressful situations together. I'd also like to find out whether we're truly compatible.
 I have two reasons for being on THE AMAZING RACE. First is the opportunity to travel the world and have a once-in-a-lifetime adventure. The second and most important is to take part in this adventure with Hayden; there was no one else I want to do this with.


 Aaron and I have traveled, but we've been dating less than a year, so it has been mostly road trips to Arizona and Washington state, where I was born and raised.
 Hayden and I haven't really traveled that much together, except a couple times we made the drive from LA to Phoenix. When we received the news that we made it on the Race, we drove from LA to Hayden's parents' house in Chewelah, Washington with both of are dogs. It was definitely a nice warm-up.


 I am deathly afraid of heights. This is something that started when I was a little girl, so I'm a little worried!
 The only thing that I fear is hearing Phil saying, ""Hayden and Aaron, you're the last Team to arrive.""


 I'm very competitive and determined, and I'm a good athlete. I give it my best in competition, and I think of myself as a good leader. I can get emotional, and I have a short fuse at times and can be controlling. I'm also terrible at reading maps and navigating.
 My biggest strengths are my competitive nature, my athletic ability and my instincts when it comes to making the right decision. My weakness, if it really is a weakness, is my laid-back behavior.


 Aaron is an incredible athlete and has a great sense of direction. He's also extremely calm and keeps a cool head in stressful situations, something I need to work on! Aaron's weakness could be his tendency to be very mellow and not get aggressive when he needs to be.
 Hayden is more competitive then I am, which can be a strength and a weakness. She's also extremely athletic and intelligent. Her biggest weakness is her temper: she can go from 0-60 in less than a second. But I love that sometimes!


 I am crazy about my dog. My friends think I'm a little weird because I treat her like she's my child. I just love her! I will also miss my family. I call home daily and talk to my parents, who live in Washington state.
 The two things that I'll miss most are my Lab, Morgan, and Sportcenter. Sorry, Mom and Dad!


 I studied Spanish in high school and college, so you could say I used to be semi-fluent, but I haven't practiced much since I graduated! That's the only other language I'm familiar with.
 I speak 14 languages. Just kidding! I speak one: good old English. We are so screwed!


 I really want to go to Africa and see some wildlife. I love Animal Planet, and I used to be addicted to watching anything that involved lions, cheetahs, elephants, etc. I've always wanted to see them up close.
 I've always wanted to go to Ireland and drink a pint of Guinness. But wherever we go, I'm sure it will be amazing.


 I really don't know if you could say I'm ""prepared"" for any particular country. I suppose if we go to Australia I could be fairly prepared, because my eldest brother lived abroad there, and my whole family has traveled to Australia and they love it, so I'm somewhat familiar with it from my family's experiences visiting there.
 With my limited travel experience, I'll have to say the country I'm most prepared for will be the beginning and ending country. I hope we make it that far.[2]

Heather & Eve,"
“”

BioQ & A
Recent Harvard Law School graduates Heather, 25, and Eve, 25, began their friendship three years ago on their first day of law school. They were drawn to each other almost immediately. As Eve describes it: ""the first girl I saw was 35 and wearing a MIT ballroom dancing sweatshirt... but then I saw Heather and she looked like the only normal person there--so we met.""
Eve attended University of Michigan for undergraduate, and Heather received a B.S. from Cornell University. A seasoned traveler, Eve spent a summer in Madrid and six months in London while attending the London School of Economics. Heather also spent a year abroad in Oxford, London. They know that their smarts could ultimately guide them to victory, but their secret weapon is to use their looks and charm to manipulate people into helping them along the way.
These friends and roommates look to this experience as an opportunity to finally put the books down and travel the world before starting their law careers. Eve hopes this will also help her overcome some of her biggest fears, which are flying and extreme outdoor sports, while Heather hopes that her enthusiasm for adventure and challenge will rub off on her teammate.

Heather resides in Boston. Her birth date is September 17. Eve lives in New York City and her birth date is November 10, and she is a proud Scorpio.[1]


 More limited than I would like, but always incredible. I traveled around Europe during college and enjoyed experiencing different cultures. More recently, I've backpacked through Central America. This was my first solo traveling experience. I loved the different cultures, the adventure travel each country offered (hitting volcanoes in Costa Rica, rapelling in Belize, exploring Mayan ruins in Guatemala, scuba diving in Honduras, and the ultimate flexibility of solo travel.
 Hectic, amazing, life-changing. I've lived in England and Spain for extended periods of time, as well as traveled to the Middle East, Central America, South America and Europe. Submerging myself in other cultures taught me many lessons about myself and our American culture, and reminded me how small my existence is.


 Navigating through foreign cities for the first time.
 Flying. I have always dreaded getting to wherever I am going—planes, trains, automobiles—but once I am there, I realize it was all worth it.


 Good hiking shoes and socks.
 Good socks for dry feet.


Heather: To enjoy adventure travel while gaining insight into myself and perspective on my place in the world.
Eve: I believe that the Race is my personal odyssey. Going to Harvard, I have spent three years in my head; that is where I excel. I am not a physically adventurous person, and the challenges that I will (hope to) face will force me to confront some of my biggest fears.


 Nope!
 No, Heather and I have traveled separately, but traveling together will be a new, exciting and scary experience for both of us.


 Getting hopelessly lost while driving through some South American jungle or African desert.
 Losing in the first round.


 Strengths: adrenaline junkie; I love the challenges, and hopefully will pass some of that enthusiasm onto Eve. Weaknesses: poor sense of direction and don't love cities.
 I am good at getting things (so far). I can work bureaucracies and DMV people: you know, the kind of person that has power over you for five minutes and uses their power to oppress you for the full time you are in their presence. I am a good talker. On the other hand, I sometimes freeze up during physical challenges. I have a lot of fear.


 Strengths: negotiating airline tickets; getting free stuff from people; thinking creatively. Weaknesses: fearful of flying and certain physical challenges.
 Heather is competent, strong (physically and emotionally), and spontaneous. We have fun together.


 Talking to my friends and family on the phone.
 My family and friends. I miss them now and we haven't even started yet.


 A little French and Spanish.
 Spanish, un poco.


 Thailand, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, South Africa, Chile
 I would love to visit the Far East and Southeast Asia. I have heard that Vietnam is the most amazing country.


 Central America (Costa Rica, Belize, Honduras, Guatemala), Greece, England
 Heather and I feel most prepared for Costa Rica and England. We have both spent extended periods of time in these countries, and would kick ass here.[2]

Hope & Norm,"
“”Bio[]Hope and Norm were 20 years old when they met in Clinton, Tennessee. It was July 1983, the summer before their junior year in college. Norm played it cool, waiting about a month before asking Hope out. After dating Norm for three years, Hope moved to Clinton and the two were married. They've done a little traveling together, and both have enjoyed the adventure and the quality time together.
Hope and Norm decided to team up for THE AMAZING RACE mostly for the challenge and the adventure. According to Hope, ""I would not have signed up with anyone else! Norm could complete the race with anyone and have a great time. Our strengths are that we compliment each other's weaknesses."" When thinking about how participating in THE AMAZING RACE will affect their relationship, Hope says, ""We think that the Race will make us stronger and will add to our memories of one another that will last a lifetime.""
Q & A[]
 I'm driven, good at scheduling, and have good communication skills. However, I tend to make decisions impulsively. I have no foreign language skills and no sense of direction.
 I'm competitive and have good listening skills, but I have trouble making decisions.
 Norm is extremely patient and kind, as well as physically strong. He likes to keep his options open, and is able to look at situations and see lots of choices. Norm's weakness is his strength. He has a hard time asserting his way with others and will put someone else before himself, rather than risk hurting that individual or treating them with disrespect.
 Hope is very organized and can make decisions fairly quickly, with adequate sleep! She is physically strong and has a lot of courage. Her weakness is that she is too open and wants to trust people. She tends to include others in decisions and therefore weakens our advantage.

 I take care of acute medical, surgical and traumatic emergencies. I'm also involved in the teaching of medical residents.
 Decisive, resourceful and reliable.
 Traveling, acting (Shakespearean Theater) and hiking (Naina is training with me to trek up Mt. Kilimanjaro).
 I'm most proud of my children, who have grown up to be well-educated, cultured, confident young people. Most importantly, they are good, honest citizens who I would love to have as my friends if they were not my children.
 Hugh Grant – suave, sophisticated and debonair.
 Mila Kunis – cute, vivacious, talented and fun-loving.
 Nothing about traveling really scares me. I do realize, however, that one must be careful and I take sensible precautions for health and safety. The thrill of traveling is in venturing into and exploring unfamiliar places.
 Traveling excites me because it allows me to venture into and explore unfamiliar places and cultures. I gain new perspectives into people, places and things.
 As an ER physician, I am accustomed to making final decisions which must be implemented immediately without questions. Given that temperament, I am not always receptive to others' thoughts and ideas. It is my hope to change that by being more open to Naina's thoughts and ideas, which admittedly are sometimes better than mine!
 She buys too many clothes, which I think she doesn't wear. (Although, she says she does!)
 I would love to visit China. A country previously closed to the West is now opening its doors. I would love to learn about and explore its rich culture, tradition and people.
 Both of us are headstrong and highly opinionated. The Race will help us, if not force us, to learn how to compromise and work with one another as we strive towards a mutual goal of winning the Race.

 Graduating from USC with honors.
 Anne Hathaway – beautiful personality. She loves to laugh, talented and fit.
 Dr. Rey, a.k.a. Dr. 90210 – not only do they physically resemble each other but the combination of intelligence and sophistication is identical.
 What scares me the most is falling sick or being kidnapped.
 Being able to immerse myself completely in a new environment, absorbing the sights, sounds and history around me. And through this process, hopefully discovering more of who I am and what I stand for.
 Most of the time we both think that we are right. Being able to quickly resolve an issue without raising our voices or being unwilling to relent is something I hope this race allows us to work on. We are in unfamiliar territory during the Race so my wish is that we work out any kinks by compromising quickly and doing what's best within the circumstance we find ourselves in.
 I don't know if it's deliberate or not, but I think my dad chooses to have selective hearing. Most times when I am talking to him I'll have to repeat questions several times before he sometimes will acknowledge that he is listening to me. And then while I am still talking to him, he'll walk away stating that his mind is elsewhere. It can be frustrating!
 I would love to go to Kenya and go on an African Safari or visit Egypt to experience the rich and ancient cultural history first hand.
 I come from a big family, so I have never been able to travel alone with my dad. I see this as an opportunity for adventure and exploration; where I get my dad all to myself and we are able to discover how we could improve upon our relationship as father/daughter but at the same time stay true to who we are as individuals.

 Seeing new places, meeting new people and having the opportunity to walk in the shoes and live a day in the life of others.
 Both of us are a bit type-A and a little head strong. I hope that running the Race will allow us to learn how to work together in a level headed, respectful way while learning to value the other's POV.
 Frequently, I think that he is too headstrong. When he takes a position, he will hold that position, despite all logical arguments to the contrary.
 Goree Island in Senegal. As an African-American, I think that I will likely never trace back my specific roots. Going to Goree Island would give me some sense of connection with my ancestors.

 Idries at times can be passive-aggressive and patronizing. When we disagree, he rarely confronts you directly, but instead is holier than thou and stubborn.
 ""The door of no return"" in Ghana. I have always hated the fact that as an African American I do not know where my ancestors came from. Walking those grounds would mean that I might be setting foot where my ancestor once walked.

Cara Rosenthal (26); Jaime Edmondson (29)
 Boca Raton, Fla./Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.
 Cara (Law Student); Jaime (Former Police Officer)
 Former NFL Cheerleaders
Cara and Jaime met four years ago while trying out for the Miami Dolphins cheerleading squad. The two made an instant connection and have been friends ever since. Cara is planning to attend law school and Jaime is a former police officer. 
Cara, a graduate of UCLA, is currently working for a non-profit fundraising organization benefiting individuals with mental disabilities. She prides herself upon being a loyal and devoted friend. Cara even deferred attending her first year of law school just to support Jaime's dream to run in this Race around the world. Cara is a true thespian who enjoys dancing and singing. She describes herself as compassionate, intelligent and outgoing. 
Jaime comes from a family of police officers. Following in her mother and father's footsteps, she graduated from the police academy and donned the uniform for a few years. Jaime is an avid animal lover and volunteers at a non profit no kill shelter for dogs. She was also a cheerleader for the Miami Dolphins for six years and was chosen to represent the squad at the 2007 Pro Bowl. Jaime enjoys reading and traveling and describes herself as adventurous, passionate and witty. Cara's biggest pet peeve about Jaime is that she tends to be stubborn and a bit of a control freak, while Jaime claims that Cara is too nice and needs to stop worrying about keeping the peace. Both Jaime and Cara have a highly competitive nature and a need to win. 

Don't put it past these two to use their good looks to their advantage for a shot at the million dollars and the chance to become the first ever all female team to win the Race.[1]

 Season 14/2nd place
 Over-packing! I could have been fine with about 7-10 pounds less stuff in my pack.
 Finishing the Race from the Starting Line to the Finish Line.
 Switzerland. It had the most magical scenery and it made me do something I would never have done if there had not been a million dollar carrot dangling at the bottom—bungee jumping.
 Who wouldn't want to do an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity twice?
 My whole life changed since the last race. I moved to LA, became Playboy's Playmate of the Month (Miss January 2010), traveled the country nonstop and am living a life I never dreamed of before the last Race. I love every moment!
 Animals.
 People are often surprised to learn I was a police officer.
 Australia. It is the one place I had hoped to visit during the last race.
 Luck! We were solid racers when it came to the actual tasks but the luck with the taxis was a killer. We're hoping that turns around this time!
 I hope to win, not for the million dollars, but because finishing in second place the first time around, I now feel like winning is the only way to top it.
 I don't have any pet peeves about Cara. I chose her the first time to be my partner for exactly that reason. She is the perfect balance to me and honestly one of the only people I know who I think could handle racing with me.
 This is probably the most boring answer ever, but I would put it in a retirement fund.
 I believe Cara and I ran a good solid race the first time, and plan to run that way again.

 Packing way too much stuff in our backpacks. We were each carrying twenty five pounds and we didn't need half of it!
 The whole race was memorable but I really remember the plethora of ailments, injuries and occurrences I sustained while racing. I fell running down the mountain in Germany and busted my knee wide open, had a lung infection and somehow managed to find piles of animal feces to step in all the time throughout multiple countries.
 I really loved Guilin, China. It was a truly beautiful place and a fascinating juxtaposition of old and new.
 Redemption! I hate to lose almost as much as I love to win.
 I have not really changed. I am still the same spirited, driven and competitive person I was last time.
 I am most passionate about friendship. My father always told me to be friends with everyone and to see the good in people. I have tried to live by this advice and as a result I am fortunate to have incredible friends.
 That my law school outlines are coming on the road with me as I am taking my finals as soon as I return from this Race! So people may be surprised to learn that I'm moderately insane!
 Luck! Last race, Jaime and I weren't the luckiest, but we still persevered leg after leg. This time, we hope to have a little luck.
 To experience a once-in-a-lifetime adventure, AGAIN!
 Jaime's impatience and complete disregard for others' feelings is my pet peeve about her.
 First of all, it's not IF I win, but WHEN I win. Secondly, it will probably be something unexpected.

 Yes, we won't be starving ourselves. Last time we pretty much only ate on airplanes when we were racing. Being conservative with our limited funds is important, but so is nourishment![2]

 Sometimes in the heat of an argument, she says things she doesn't mean just because she is mad at that moment, and it hurts my feelings.
 I can get annoyed when she gets obnoxious and uncontrollable.
 I would like to visit Africa just to see where my ancestors originated from and have the chance to interact with the locals.
 I hope to maintain the amazing sisterhood we already have established. I want to encourage her outside of our comfort zone and want her to know I am always proud of her, no matter what.

 I hate when Jazmine gets dramatic about things like the weather.
 I would like to visit France the most because my grandma is from France and my mom was born there and grew up there.
 I hope to gain an even closer relationship with my teammate and create even more memories by going on this once in a lifetime experience. I want us to be 80yrs old talking about how we went on The Amazing Race.

 Other than being on , when I was 18 years old, I headed out to Miami and auditioned to become a Miami Heat Dancer. Went up against about 300 women for a spot on the team and I made it!
 Language barriers.
 New experiences! You really learn so much when you travel. I also love food so trying new cuisine is always exciting!
 I have been in 3 serious relationships. All pretty much ended due to wrong timing. But either way, I still haven't found a man who is able to keep up with me and share my same passions and future goals.
 Deal breakers for me would be a man who does not want marriage or children, who is disrespectful or dishonest, or who does not take care of their appearance and body. Also, if they smoke cigarettes, stay away from me.
 I am looking for a respectful gentleman who is passionate, motivated and confident, with a good sense of humor. Being attractive with a great body doesn't hurt either!
 Someone who is rude and disrespectful, someone who lacks passion and confidence, and a bad kisser!

 Australia!! It's a beautifully diverse country. Plus, they speak and understand English. Every Aussie I've ever met has been wonderful!
 Proving to ourselves that we are great partners and can work and survive together under pressure! This would be a great accomplishment together!

 From running this race I hope to strengthen an already tight bond with my father, as well as show him he has raised a great and capable young man. He is the best father I could have ever asked for and I want to give back by showing him his work did happen in vain or go unnoticed.

 Obviously our Express Pass fail! Oy Vey!
 I loved every part of Bora Bora! My favorite memory was paddling to Phil after FINALLY finding our clue in the sand castles. It was such a rush knowing that we were in first place! I couldn't believe it!
 Definitely Bora Bora!
 Well, we still have an Express Pass to use... Kidding! There is nothing that even comes close to The Amazing Race. No matter what place you finish in, you have the opportunity to be a part of something so incredible. We went to amazing countries, met new people and had the chance to compete together for $1 million! It really was priceless.
 We are older, hopefully wiser and we are engaged!
 Running, travel, adventure!
 We are engaged. We are planning our wedding in October and could really use that million!
 Language barriers, taxi drivers, me getting tunnel vision and dancing/singing challenges.
 He talks to me in computer code language.
 Anywhere in Africa. We didn't get a chance to go last season and it looked incredible.
 We want to see as many countries as possible. We were eliminated fairly early last time and we missed out on some cool places. Other than that, we just want to enjoy the adventure together and know that we did our best no matter what place we finish in.
 We plan to be more cautious and less competitive. That may sound like a weird plan for a race, but I felt like last time we were always thinking ahead and strategizing for the next challenge. We don't care about getting first on any leg except for the last!

 Failed to use our Express Pass.
 Racing across crazy, cool-colored water in Bora Bora on a jet ski with Jess on the back, in pursuit of a million dollars. Like, literally looking over and thinking ""If we can pass those guys over there, we'll be in first place towards a million dollars!"" I figure when James Bond is racing across the ocean, at any moment they might yell, ""Cut!"" but with the Race, it's for real!
 Bora Bora
 There's nothing else like it. Even if you could afford to travel the world and had the time to do it you couldn't really replicate the experience. It's traveling and competing and stepping into the unknown and meeting lots of cool new people along the way and racing for a million dollars with your best friend.
 I'd say probably the main difference is the length of my hair. No, but seriously, I think the main difference is that we know what an Express Pass is.
 I like to write code, surf, drink coffee and hang out with friends and family.
 That Phil really likes my hair this season.

 She still leaves a trail of bobby pins wherever she goes.

 I do drug and gun interdiction and respond to priority calls for service: burglaries, robberies, homicides, alarm drops.
 Positive, happy and extrovert.
 Bench pressing, squatting and dead lifting. I also enjoy shooting guns and sleeping.
 The accomplishment I am most proud of is becoming Youngstown Police Department's first female K-9 handler.
 What scares me the most about traveling is reading maps.
 What excites me the most about traveling is seeing the world and experiencing different cultures.
 I hope my partner is a male, can read a map and isn't emotional...because I am as emotional as 15 women put together.
 It would be difficult for me to be a partner with someone who is negative.
 I think the biggest challenges my partner and I will face will be the traveling itself due to language barriers, deciding whether to take a taxi or a bus and reading foreign maps.
 I would most like to visit Italy because of the history, culture and of course food.
 Other than winning one million dollars, I hope to accomplish breaking out of my comfort zone. Traveling, especially without a phone or GPS, has never been a strong suit of mine.[1]

 I am a 1SG/E-8 Airborne Civil Affairs Soldier. Civil Affair soldiers are often at the forefront of a mission's interaction with local government officials, civil society and other civilian partners in the international community. Prior to this, I was a U.S. Army Drill Sergeant for five years.
 Three words that describe me are competitive, determined and empathetic. I believe being empathetic may act as a weakness on occasion, but it also keeps my morals and ethical value intact, so in my eyes it's the biggest characteristic I possess.
 My favorite hobbies are running, remodeling houses and RV's, and taking on any challenge. My family and I are currently remodeling a 1985 Fleetwood RV and it's been a blast.
 The accomplishment that I am most proud of is being chosen as a contestant on THE AMAZING RACE! The next biggest accomplishment that I am proud of is serving my country and fighting my fears of height by rappelling from helicopters and parachuting from airplanes.
 What scares me the most is traveling through an unknown place in this world without having a phone. I have become so dependent on such a small device that I am not sure I can function without it, but I am willing to try.
 Experiencing different cultures and being able to see the world that people 100 years ago couldn't experience.
 That he or she is smart and carries the strengths that I may have weakness in.
 Qualities that I would have a difficult time with my partner having would be arrogance, not working as a teammate and panicking under pressure.
 I think that the biggest challenge my partner and I will face is the ability to work as a team because we have never met each other and trust and communication is usually a foundation for being great teammates and trust and communication is built over time.
 The one country and place I really want to visit is Greece! I hope there's a chance to visit it on this adventure.
 What I hope to accomplish on this race is to regain some confidence and give myself a challenge that most people don't get the opportunity to have. Just a few months ago, after being married for 8 years, I endured a painful divorce and the loss of my biological father from a battle with cancer. This is my opportunity to feel alive again, regardless if I win money or not.[2]

BioBefore the Race
Jim & Marsha are a father-daughter Team from Jacksonville, Florida. Jim, who is married to Marsha's mother, Linda, is a helicopter pilot who spent 23 years in the military, including a tour in Vietnam. As a military family, they were fortunate to have had their primary residence in Jacksonville for many years, but they have also spent two years living in Germany. Marsha is a law student at the University of Florida College of Law. She said that as a child she was an ugly duckling, and still is, but thinks she transformed herself when she became an NFL cheerleader for the Jacksonville Jaguars and also posed for the cheerleaders' calendar.

Jim & Marsha believe that this experience will give them the opportunity to work as partners rather than father and daughter. Marsha says she hopes this will force her dad to view her in a different light. Jim says they are excited about competing in THE AMAZING RACE 5 because ""it would be a chance of a lifetime, especially for someone like me, who has never won a thing in his life!""[1]

 We're father and daughter; need we say more?

 Traditional father and daughter, with all the age-old disagreements and concerns.

 We've never traveled together before.

 We both thrive on adventure, and the thought of some father/daughter bonding was appealing.

 I hope it will become stronger by learning more about each other.

 I bring organization, discipline and experience. A weakness could be the inability to treat Marsha as an equal instead of my daughter.


 Determination and athletic ability are her strong points. Being impulsive could be a weakness.[2]

 I think being able to support each other. We've been together for a while. We know where each one might need a little bit of encouragement. So just being able to step in at that right moment and give that extra encouragement so the other one can complete a challenge or get to where we need to go. That's what I see.

 Victor's just very smart. He knows a lot of stuff. He's just a walking encyclopedia. And so I would say that would be one trait I don't possess. [Laughs.]

""Team Guido"", the avid adventurers from Season 1, return for another attempt at the $1 million prize. Claiming they've had their bags packed since they returned home from the first season, they are ready to go!
Admittedly, one of the most conniving teams in the history of Race, ""Team Guido"" were the masters of the old-school strategy and successfully outplayed most of their former competitors.
Although Joe has done really well for himself professionally, his reason for returning to Race is to win so that he and Bill can retire and never have to work again. He describes himself as loyal, intelligent and responsible. He also claims that the biggest difference between Bill and himself is that he saves more money while Bill is a spender. Bill on the other hand describes himself as meticulous and upbeat, claiming that his biggest fear is heights and looking terrible on national television.

After 20 years, Bill and Joe remain committed and enjoy life to the fullest. One question remains though... After being away from the game for so long, do they have what it takes to compete against the best racers of all time?[2]

 Being cool, calm and collected.
 You would say that. It's literally your nature.
 Because it's my nature. [Laughs.]
 I think being a well-rounded contestant, being able to do a little bit of everything.
 I like that.
 Oh, you like my answer. Interesting.
 [Laughs.]

 I always say Natalie and Nadiya.
 And I'm inclined to say Afghanimals just because of how much fun they have and keep it really light. But they're also competitive at the same time.
 But I'm like Natalie, and you're like Nadiya. I'll be carrying you for most of the challenges.
 [Laughs.] Wow.

 Joe is very easygoing, and I wish I could be that sometimes.

 I mean, I don't know if you would call it a skill. But I have to go back to positivity. I feel like if you're constantly positive and telling yourself, ""No matter what the challenge is, I can do this,"" rather than ""I can't do this"" or ""this is too hard,"" you're going to get through any challenge. And you're gonna get through it a lot faster than if you have that negative attitude or that negative thought.
 ""I can do this. I can learn how to do this. This won't slow me down. This isn't gonna stop me."" If you've got that attitude, you're head and shoulders above everybody else.

 I think we've both had different people we've talked about. I really like Jet and Cord. I liked them a lot. I like how happy they always were. I liked how they always got along. And that's the reason so many people liked them. They remind me a lot of our dynamic. We're not cowboys or anything like that. We do come from Idaho, but we're not cowboys. But we have that same fun dynamic. I think I would model how I would hope to portray myself after Jet and Cord.
 A lot of what I see in the Afghanimals, the way they like to have fun and they interact with the people wherever they are and just mess around and joke around. That's another thing that I see in us is that fun, upbeat, play with the people that are in the towns that you're in, and all that too.

 Nothing. It's an adventure. I'm on vacation. Who cares?
 I love learning new things about people and customs. People do things differently all around the world, and it's easy for us to believe that our way is somehow better or makes more sense than somebody else's. But when you travel and you're open to learning, you see that every way is valid and worthwhile and worthy of respect. We do things a certain way because that's what took hold where we are, not because our ways are any better than anybody else's. I really enjoy being reminded of that again and again and again by seeing it firsthand.
 Australia. I love it down there—the land, the animals, the accents. If I get eliminated in Australia, I may never come home.
 It would be a lot of fun for me to hang out and goof around with Joey. We've always lived on opposite coasts, and we've always competed against each other. We're friends, and we've traveled together for contests, but we've always been rivals. Win or lose, it'd be cool to bond over this adventure and this shared goal.

“”
John Vito, 28, a Government Bond Trader, and Jill, 24, a business consultant with Cap Gemini Ernest and Young, are both originally from Staten Island, New York. John Vito still lives there, but Jill currently resides in Manhattan. They met three years ago after a group of their friends spent many late summer nights hanging out and going to night clubs. They have been romantically involved for almost a year.
The tragic events of September 11 personally and deeply affected both John Vito and Jill. Her older brother F.T., who was also John Vito's best friend, was working on the 105th floor of the World Trade Center as a Vice President for Cantor Fitzgerald. Jill had applied for the show's first installment with her brother, and after her devastating loss she decided to reapply in tribute to his memory. ""After losing him on 9/11, I felt I should apply for the show again, and this time, who should be a better runner up than his best friend?"" Their motto is to live life to the fullest, and as John Vito says, ""the opportunity of traveling the world with Jill is the greatest reward.""
Jill describes herself as spontaneous, intelligent and sensitive, while John Vito describes himself as detail-oriented, decisive and organized. They both love physical activities and spending time with their family and friends. Jill is most looking forward to leaving behind the day-to-day routines of life, her cell phone and email. John Vito is excited to learn about different cultures and people.

They feel that their combination of wits and brawn will help land them the coveted prize of $1 million. Her birth date is November 13. His birth date is August 3.[1]

 My previous travel experience has been for either business or relaxation. The type of adventures we will encounter on this Race will be the opportunity of a lifetime.
 My previous travel experience involves traveling to Europe on multiple occasions. During one trip I backpacked with a friend for six weeks and traveled to 14 different cities. On another trip I traveled throughout Europe for three weeks with my sister.


 I feel that the most stressful aspect of traveling is the possibility of being lost in a foreign place.
 Getting lost in unknown parts of the world.


 I feel the most important item in my backpack is a compass. We are hoping this will allow us to rely less on luck.
 The most important item is not in my backpack, it is on my wrist. A few months after September 11 a charity organization sent family members of victims from the WTC silver bracelets with their loved one's name engraved on it. I've been wearing it ever since receiving it, and it is just one more way I feel close to my brother every day.


 THE AMAZING RACE is an exciting opportunity to travel the world and participate in adventures I would otherwise never experience. To experience this opportunity with Jill is the greatest reward.
 I applied to the first season of THE AMAZING RACE with my brother, but never heard back. After losing him 9/11 in the WTC, I wanted to do the Race on his behalf and with his best friend. I know the reason JV and I have gotten this far is because we have my brother on our side, making this all possible.


 Jill & I traveled to Costa Rica this past March. It was our first vacation together and was the perfect combination of relaxation and adventure. We hiked to a beautiful waterfall, went canopying across the forest top and spent hours relaxing by the pool.
 JV and I traveled to Costa Rica in March. It was our first vacation and also the first time we were able to experience many adventurous act ivies together. We cannot wait to see what is in store for us throughout the entire Race.


 My biggest fear would be a bad decision that would cause us to be eliminated. We are so excited to travel the world, and would be extremely disappointed if we didn't make it to the finish line.
 Losing.


 I am generally an organized person in both my actions and thoughts. In a race such as this it can be positive and negative. Being organized will help us to develop a concise plan and avoid careless mistakes. It may also waste valuable time.
 I am a quick thinker, can read situations clearly and I am very spontaneous. I feel at times I can be impatient, but hopefully this will turn out to be a strength during the Race.


 Jill is the smartest and most energetic person I know. This combination of brains and energy, along with her spontaneity, will lead us to the finish line.
 JV is full of strengths. Along with his physical strength, mentally he is extremely intelligent, very organized, responsible and full of patience. I do not think he brings any weaknesses to our Team.


 Family and friends.
 My family and friends.


 I speak a limited amount of Spanish. I studied Spanish in high school and practiced the language on my vacation to Spanish-speaking countries.
 I understand and speak a limited amount of Italian.


 The finish line …1st.
 I am hoping to visit the Greek Islands and the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.


 I don't feel best prepared for any specific country. I am prepared to take this Race one leg at a time and will give it my all.
 Mentally, I am prepared for all countries; however, having traveled to various cities in Italy, I feel I am the best prepared for that country.[2]
Season 3's John Vito and Jill are back for another chance at winning the million dollar prize. What's different this time around? These former lovebirds are no longer romantically involved. Changing the dynamic of their relationship allows them to focus all of their efforts on running the best Race possible. Both individuals are fierce competitors and know they have the skills and experience necessary to win.
John Vito, a trader in New York City, and Jill, a product controller, both originally from Staten Island, New York, currently reside in Manhattan. Jill describes herself as spontaneous, intelligent and sensitive, while John Vito describes himself as detail-oriented, decisive and organized. They both love physical activities and spending time with their family and friends.
Both John Vito and Jill share the tragic memory from the loss of Jill's older brother F.T., who was also John Vito's best friend. F.T. was working on the 105th floor of the World Trade Center as a Vice President for Cantor Fitzgerald on September 11, 2001. Jill had originally applied for the show's first installment with her brother, and after her devastating loss she decided to reapply in tribute to his memory and ran the Race in Season 3 with his best friend John Vito.

This time around they mean business and are back to prove that that they can Race with the best of them. Both are driven, competitive and motivated. They feel that this combination along with their wits and brawn will help land them the coveted prize of $1 million.[3]

Jon, 40, is married with three children, and lists his current occupation as ""Human Cannonball"" for Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. He has traveled with them for the past 20 years and has over 5,000 notches in his cannonball belt. He graduated from Suffolk Community College and has also studied at the Disney Institute and Clown college. Jon is determined to win. He fears ""getting into an accident and not being able to support his family."" Jon enjoys golf, cooking and watching sports, and describes himself as ""friendly, honest and ambitious."" He speaks no foreign languages and has traveled to Mexico and Canada. His teammate, Al, most disappoints him with his ""lack of trust before performing together. Al gets so nervous he drives me crazy every time."" Jon admits that he procrastinates and is a ""go-with-the-flow type,"" while Al ""gets stressed out."" Of his clowning skills, Jon says, ""If I can pick it up, I can balance it on my nose/chin.""

Al, 34, currently works as a substitute teacher and as a cruise ship entertainer. He holds a BA in Special Education. Al is a ""people person"" and no stranger to traveling.

He considers himself ""friendly, determined, outgoing, compassionate and emotional."" He fears heights and eating ""yecchy things,"" getting sick with no help, or ""getting stuck in a life-threatening situation with no way out."" The only time his teammate, Jon, disappoints him is when he doesn't follow through with things. Jon will be ""Mr. Nice Guy,"" and they'll get ""screwed"" because he doesn't ""bluntly explain what the deal is."" They sometimes argue, but if he's upset, Al usually gets quiet first, or he'll go off ""alone and just scream out loud or have a good cry."" Al's the motivator, while Jon can ""waste time.""[1]

"
Jonathan & Victoria,"


BioBefore the Race
Jonathan & Victoria were set up on a blind date seven years ago, and have been married for three years. They reside in Los Angeles, where Jonathan is an entrepreneur who owns a spa as well as other business ventures, and Victoria is a model/ pop artist painter. They decided to go on the Race in hopes of getting their relationship back on track after many grueling discussions about starting a family that have taken a toll on their marriage.
Jonathan describes himself as having a ""type A"" personality, while Victoria says she is resourceful. They hope this combination will help them be victorious on the Race. One of the challenges for them on the Race is going to be trusting each other's instincts and putting their bickering aside.
Victoria recalls that one of the worst moments in their relationship was when they had a fight on a trip to Miami and their entire argument was recorded after her cell phone accidentally dialed her mother's answering machine.

Their primary reason for doing THE AMAZING RACE is to win. The $1 million prize comes in a close second. Although both agree that their biggest fear is not being able to speak the languages, they look forward to experiencing new cultures and people.[1]


 I feel I am a seasoned traveler. I have been to all types of countries, rich and poor. I prefer the Third World countries because of the richness that comes with the cultures.
 I have traveled a lot, so I feel pretty well traveled. I know my way around an airport and airlines.


 I love to travel, so there is very little stress that comes my way. I find the most stressful part, if any, is the layovers from one airport to another if you're missing flights.
 The most stressful part about travel knowing what to pack and being tired and on a long layover. Being tired and uncomfortable is always stressful.


 I love people. I love to interact with them. I think traveling at warp speed around the world and though the different countries will give me a great understanding and perspective on the human race as a whole. The money would also be great to win, because I would give away 33 percent of it to PETA, a charity that is close to my heart.
 I want the million, and I want the adventure. It's going to put my relationship to a big test. Hopefully, both of us can learn a little more about ourselves as well as each other and grow as a couple.


 Victoria and I have traveled to many places in the world together and have had great fun in doing so. I think THE AMAZING RACE will challenge us because of the stress element. I think under stress people become different from how you normally see them and bring out things that you never knew were there. I am hoping we can come together from all the stress the Race will put on us and win THE AMAZING RACE.
 Yes, we have traveled a lot together. We enjoy it very much. We are always searching out an adventure: no matter where we go, we seem to find our way off the beaten path. We like to take a least one day out of the trip and just walk around wherever our feet take us and just get lost. When we get too tired at the end of the day, we find a cab and have the cab take us back to our hotel. It's the nooks and crannies that hold the most character and culture of any city. Not knowing what is around the next corner is exciting.


 I fear very little, so the earth would have to open up and swallow me up to really put the fear in me. I am ready for anything the Race throws at me.
 The only thing I fear is jumping out of an airplane and coming in last or being eliminated first. Everything else I can deal with.


 Strengths: I bring the Jedi Mind Trick to THE AMAZING RACE. I can wave my hand and make the impossible happen. I love people and think that with my people skills I will be able to use my powers to get us what we need to win each leg. I believe you have to have heart to run THE AMAZING RACE. The enjoyment of this Race comes from one's passion to see the adventure as it unfolds. Weaknesses: I yell too much. I am a very passionate person, and this can show my love of life and at the same time push me to my limits. Yelling is a form of communication that only east coast people can really understand.
 I am physically strong, very resourceful, and never give up. My weakness is that I get upset when I think I'm losing.


 Victoria is a goddess and can do no wrong unless she is put under too much stress. It's going to go one way or the other for her: she will either be my rock or my atomic bomb.
 Jon is very focused and direct. He is so determined he is like a freight train, so the other Teams better not get in our way. His weakness is his intensity. He can often scare people or rub them the wrong way because he comes off too strong, and they see in his eyes that he's not to be messed with. This can also be a good thing, but doubles as his big weakness. He will scream and shout, and that gets on people's nerves.


 I will miss California and America the most. I love our country and always am happy to come home after any great journey. Home is where the heart is.
 I will miss my dog and my brother, Bryan. Bryan is my best friend, and he is always there for me. I will miss calling him for support or some positive reinforcement. He always makes me feel like a winner.


 I only speak one language, English, but I feel with my skills I can go any place in the world and find my way around. I am very open to the world and the people in it.
 I have been studying Japanese for the last two years and French and Spanish. I'm also attempting Chinese, but there are many different dialects, and I'm finding it difficult to remember any of it.


 Africa: I really want to so on safari with the Big 5; Cuba: I have been told it is quite an amazing place; China: I want to see the great wall; Spain: I want to run with the bulls; Micronesia: I was told the beaches and waters are beautiful; India: I want to see the heart of the people; Morocco: Play it again, Sam.
 I am hoping to visit Japan and China. I have always wanted to see the Great Wall. I want very much to see Africa in my lifetime too, so that is a big one for me. But no matter where we go, I know it will be places I would never have found on my own.


 Bring on the world! I am ready to have some fun.
 I guess I would have to say Japan and France, because I have studied both languages. But I feel that what is in my backpack and in my head are what are going to matter the most.[2]

"
Joseph & Monica,"
Joseph & Monica have been dating for the past three years. This fun-loving couple met at a local bar in Fayetteville, Arkansas during college when Joseph claims he ""just about broke his neck when Monica walked through the door."" After a brief separation for a few months, they missed each other tremendously and decided to give their relationship a second try. They've been together ever since.
Joseph describes himself as confident and funny, while Monica is independent and tenacious. Born and raised in the South, the couple shares a love of country music, wakeboarding and traveling. Joseph's proudest accomplishment has been building and selling his first home.
Although Monica's primary motivation for taking part on THE AMAZING RACE is to pay off her student loans, both she and Joseph are eager to take part in an experience that will bond them for life.[1]

 Partaking in new cuisines.
 We are quick to argue and both of us think we are the smartest people in the room.
 Brent never admits when he is wrong.
 There are two: Italy, because I can't believe I have never been, and Russia because of the history and culture.
 If we win, we could finally be together under the same roof every night for the first time in three years. Being apart during the workweek has been a struggle and gone on far too long.

 Morning radio personality
 I help people start their day with a smile. Also, I create and deliver four hours of content on the radio & online each morning and record and edit audio/video for web content.
 Passionate, loyal and straight-forward.
 Photography/videography, video games, travel and learning new skills/talents.
 Besides proposing to Diana with her own Amazing Race (the video went viral), I'm proud of all of the lives I have been able to change through my job.
 Bruce Willis - a really down to earth guy who tells it like it is, a tough guy with a soft heart.
 Eliza Dushku- can hang out with the guys, has an amazing heart and infectious smile.
 The lack of a second language and knowledge of some customs.
 The different cultures, seeing the beauty of mother nature, sense of accomplishment, growing as a person and seeing the world through Diana's eyes.
 Diana likes to finish my thoughts for me and then have a retort ready for points I was never trying to make. We both need to listen and hear what the other is actually trying to say.
 She doesn't answer direct questions with direct answers.
 Bora Bora; it looks like paradise. Alaska; one of the last frontiers. The UK; to visit the castles and history.
 Travel the world, experience different cultures with the most beautiful person in the world. I want to add an unbelievable chapter to our ""book of life"" which is one step closer to happily ever after. I want to show her how strong and smart she really is. I love watching her grow as a person.

 Arts and crafts, reading and exploring new places.
 I am most proud of my teaching career. I have wanted to teach since I was 5 years old. Teaching for me is not just ""what I do""...it's part of who I am. Watching my students learn and develop throughout the school year is extremely rewarding!
 Zooey Deschanel. She isn't afraid to be herself, she's super goofy and can hang out with anyone.

 The unknown! Unfamiliar places, language barriers, different customs and laws can be very scary and intimidating.
 The unknown! It's exciting to explore new sights, meet new people, experience new cultures and see the beauty of new places.
 Sometimes the ""New Yorker"" in Justin comes out. I shut down and do not want to talk to him!
 Justin always needs to be right.
 I would most like to visit Italy and the UK because my grandparents are from there. I am interested to see where my family roots started and where my grandparents grew up.
 I would love to travel around the world and experience the different cultures that I read and learn about. I hope to come home with a deeper appreciation of the diversity in the world.

 Watching movies, rock climbing and skiing

 Becoming a doctor.
 Accidentally getting lost in dangerous areas or offending local people. I would like to represent the U.S. in a positive way.
 The novelty of it. I love adventures, seeing new places and meeting new people.
 She shuts down when she gets hungry or sleepy and has a tendency to get really mean when this happens.
 Her hunger and her sleep rage – she can get pretty irrational when she feels she has been wronged.

Kami & Karli,"


BioBefore the Race
Kami & Karli are identical twins from Eugene, Oregon, who describe themselves as ""extremely competitive."" Both agree that as children they were adorable, but ornery and naughty.
Kami is the general manager of a restaurant. Her primary motivation for being on the show is ""to win! I'm very competitive."" Her pet peeve about herself is that she is always correct, all the time. Kami says that one of the most exciting moments of her life was at a Prince concert when she was asked to get on stage and dance with him.
Karli is a full-time student at the University of Oregon. She describes her motivations for being on the show as first, ""wanting the money, and second, wanting the opportunity to travel for free."" One of her fears is getting stranded in a third world country without clean bathrooms. Karli adds that she is sweeter and more forgiving than Kami.

Kami & Karli list among their similarities that they can get really upset when they are not fed, they have similar mannerisms, are ardently determined and extremely competitive. They are excited to compete in THE AMAZING RACE 5 because foreign travel and experiencing different cultures are fascinating to them.[1]

 Obviously, Kami and I met inside my mother's womb, where we kicked the s**t out of each other, I'm sure.

 Kami and I have a sweet and sour, love-hate relationship. We'll argue about petty things, but rally together and kick your a** if you try and intervene.

 Kami and I traveled to Mexico and the West Indies together. It worked because we both enjoy relaxing, reading, eating well, tipping frivolously and boozing it up. It's nice to travel with someone who knows how to have a good time.

 It seems only natural that two people who walk alike, talk alike, and sometimes act alike compete together in something so extraordinary as THE AMAZING RACE.

 We know this Race won't and can't change our relationship, because it's been this way for 26 years.

 My strengths include staying positive (most of the time) and athletic endurance. Weaknesses are my small bladder, my need for food every three hours and stubbornness.


 Kami isn't the best of drivers or navigators, but she never quits and always finishes hard.[2]

Kate & Pat,"
Kate and Pat dated for seven years before having a blessing of their union at St. Augustine's Episcopal Church three years ago. These well traveled Episcopal clergy are ready for the adventure of lifetime–but don't let the collars fool you–they can play dirty too.
Kate is an Episcopal priest and has one grown son. She claims that the biggest difference between herself and Pat is that she avoids conflict while Pat dives right in. Kate describes herself as passionate and sarcastic while Pat says she is persistent and dependable.
Pat is a vocational deacon in the Episcopal Church and her ministry in the community is to people with disabilities. She is also the mother of two sons and grandmother of three. Pat's biggest pet peeve about Kate is that she constantly misjudges her time, an issue that could surely cause problems on the Race.
Both are out to prove that they are not afraid to compete with anyone and they are extremely confident that their years of experience will help them combat the physical prowess of the younger Teams.[1]

I loved watching him play his entire life but now seeing him on TV gives me goose bumps.
 This is an obvious one - volleyball, of course! I am also very passionate about my family. My parents, sisters and brother mean the world to me; they are hilarious, crazy, fun and extremely close to one another. Love you guys!

 Seeing other cultures and seeing the world. I love to travel!
 Being open to the other person's point of view when we have our mind set on what we want to do.
 Sometimes when you talk to her and she doesn't agree, Lisa will stare at you with this blank stare and start shaking her head. And, if you are talking, you can be certain that Lisa will cut you off and she will twist anything to make herself right. Should you disagree with her she throws a fit.
 I want to go to Italy. Specifically, a little town called Ponta Corva because that is where my father's side of the family is originally from.
 I want to have an amazing experience, travel the world, have new adventures, explore new cultures and build a stronger bond of friendship with Lisa.

 Outgoing, kind, and determined.
 I love HYLO (yoga, HIIT, barre), love cooking and whipping up vegetarian meals, love any water-related activities—preferably boat cruising in the river, longboarding, and just spending time with my girlfriends!
 Competing on  is OBVIOUSLY the accomplishment I'm the most proud of.
 I love traveling so much, fear typically isn't a part of that equation. But I suppose if I had to pick something, losing my phone or wallet would be pretty scary. I had my debit card taken by an ATM in Ireland a few years back and that was my main money source with me at the time and that was no fun!
 The food! I love experiencing the culture of traveling and immersing myself into a world different than mine, but if I'm being totally honest, eating and drinking whatever I want and not feeling bad about it probably excites me the most!
 That's a tough one! Africa because of the culture and the animals or Costa Rica for the monkeys, beaches, and yoga!
 Other than winning a million dollars, the main thing I'd like to accomplish by running the race with Kaylynn is to find out what we're made of. We're best friends who are attached at the hip and do everything together but what could be cooler than running around the world together, challenging ourselves, and experiencing the world in a way that normal people don't get to. We get to experience so many different cultures while competing against ridiculously strong competitors and get to really see the strengths that we possess while doing so.

Kelly and Christy are best friends that will not settle for second best. These two go-getters have been through a lot in the last year and want to prove that they can overcome anything.
Kelly, having been a collegiate dancer, and Christy, a collegiate cheerleader, are physically fit and are up for the challenges the Race will bring. They have supported one another through their own marriages and the dissolution of both, have worked together at the same company, have both remodeled homes and have tackled life together for the last 10 years.
Kelly works as a sales representative for a pharmaceutical company. She describes their team as quick, resourceful and resilient. She admits that she has a tendency to become impatient, and that Christy can be temperamental, but realizes they will need to focus on controlling these traits if they are going to be successful on the road.
Christy, a business development representative for a title insurance company, is determined to be the first Amazing Race all-female team to take the $1 million prize. She believes she and Kelly can accomplish anything they set their minds to. Christy also believes that their sweet, Texas charm will prove to be a very resourceful asset throughout the Race. Christy describes their team as magnetic, energetic and kind-hearted.
Neither has traveled extensively outside of the U.S., but both are eager to change that. This team's drive, experience and competitiveness may provide them with the opportunity to see all the world has to offer.[1]
"
Kelly & Jon,"


BioQ & A
Kelly, 30, has been modeling for the past 10 years and is an aspiring children's book writer. She met her fiancé in a ""dive bar"" in South Beach, Miami. Kelly admits to being high-strung and obsessive, ""athletic, bossy and silly."" She enjoys scuba diving, running and traveling, and attended two years of junior college. Kelly and Jon recently had a ""bad breakup on their three-year anniversary"" over getting married, but since then, they've gotten engaged. Nothing's off-limits in conversation. Kelly believes that she ""could fit in at the presidential banquet or at a frat party,"" though Barbara Bush once told her at a VIP Texan party to ""stay away from George."" She gets motion sickness and fears spiders, bees, heights and sharks.

Originally from New Jersey, Jon, 28, is a real estate agent and has worked as a model and bartender in the past. He's an ""all-around good athlete"" and graduate of Rutgers University, which he attended on a Lacrosse scholarship. He enjoys skiing and boating and considers himself to be ""spontaneous, competitive and funny."" Jon claims to have no fears and he often blows off steam by playing football on the beach. He spent some time in Thailand with his teammate and has traveled to Italy, France, Holland, the UK and Portugal. He speaks no foreign languages. Jon describes Kelly as ""very sympathetic for others,"" but admits that one of his pet peeves about himself is that he is extremely critical of other people.[1]


 I think I am well traveled. Over the years, with modeling, I've been to several countries.
 I have traveled extensively throughout Europe and some of Asia.


 Flying! It's more annoying than stressful.
 Airports.


 Birth control! Don't want to screw that up. Can you imagine?
 Clean underwear: it all starts from there.


 Crazy people do crazy things!
 It is a once-in-a-lifetime experience to travel the world with my fiancée.


 We went backpacking in Thailand. We bought plane tickets with no itinerary and winged it for a month. It was great!
 Yes, we have traveled to Portugal, Ireland and backpacking through Thailand.


Kelly: Letting Jon down, but mostly myself.
Jon: Making some stupid mistake that gets us eliminated.


 Strengths: competitive. Weaknesses: clumsy and high-strung. When Jon's one extreme, I'm the opposite. We balance each other.
 We are very athletic and well-traveled, but we can waste time arguing about stupid stuff.


 Jon's a strong person with real commitment. He'll make me feel safe and calm in the stressful situations.
 Kelly is everything I am not: she is thoughtful, compassionate and a caring person. She can get frustrated easily, though.


 Venting to my friends and family (usually about Jon).
 I really will not miss anything, I am so grateful to have this experience.


 English and travel Spanish.
 I speak English, but in Miami that is a second language.


 Egypt! Pyramids!
 I would love to visit the Galapagos Islands, but that might be a little tricky to get to.


 All the hot and humid places.
 I would say the US. It would be great if the final leg was through my hometown in New Jersey.[2]

Bio Q & A
Ken, a freelance casting director in New York City, and Gerard, a financial consultant in New Jersey, are the odd couple brother Team. They describe themselves as ""different in almost every aspect of their lives...married vs. single, conservative vs. liberal, straight vs. gay,"" but they share a similar sense of humor and love of laughter. Of eight siblings growing up, they provided the comic relief to their family…and still do.
Despite their dramatic differences, Ken and Gerard enjoy spending time together. Some of their favorite activities are eating, laughing, walking around New York City and talking politics. Now that they don't live in the same city anymore, they are looking forward to spending an extended period of time together.
After receiving his Masters degree at Columbia University, Gerard became a youth director on the Lower Eastside. During that period, he is extremely proud of having put together successful programs for over 1,500 immigrant youths. Gerard currently resides in New Jersey, and is an accomplished financial advisor with a major firm.
One of Ken's greatest accomplishments was going out on his own as a freelance casting director five years ago. He is also extremely proud of joining Gotham Volleyball, a gay volleyball league. This was one of the first times Ken felt that his homosexuality didn't interfere with him playing sports and being part of a team. Now 40, Ken wants to go on this adventure to fulfill some of his short-term goals, face his fears and live his life.

Ken's birth date is May 15. Gerard is happily married ten years to his wife Jennifer and is the father of twins. He celebrates his birthday on November 16.[1]


 I have not been out of the country since 1987, when I was performing. I love to travel, and try to do it at least 3-4 times a year. My business has taken me to many places throughout the USA.
 I've been to many countries, but nothing recently. I went in high school and college mostly (Spain, Italy, England, Portugal, Mexico, Canada and the Caribbean).


 Having to wait many times out at the check-in gate. I also hate having to make connections to other flights with minimal time. Time changes (zones) take an effect on me.
 Having to wait—delays—and time changes (loss of sleep).


 My most important item is my ""Just for Men"" (medium brown) to dye my goatee (Vandyke). I turn white in a matter of days.
 My toiletry bag: toothbrush, paste, deodorant (creature comforts).


 I just turned 40 and was tired of being an inactive participant in many aspect of my life! It sounded so exciting to be able to travel at someone else's expense and have an opportunity, 1 in 12, to be paid a million dollars.
 I wanted to go on a great adventure.


 We recently went to out cousin Annie's wedding in Michigan. We got lost traveling between the church and the reception. I was also chauffeuring other people and we were very late and unfortunately missed the cocktail hour (horrors)!
 Yes, we have a lot of fun together and laugh a lot! (And we have some funny fights.)


 Heights and not having much (any) downtime without my brother.
 Heights and lack of sleep.


 I can see ""outside"" the box while thinking ahead. My strengths are that I am always thinking about the next step. I get things done. The downfall is that I am disappointed and hold things in when they don't go my way.
 I am organized and have a good sense of direction and am good with maps. I have a hard time being pushy (assertive) with airport personnel, hotel personnel, etc.


 He is very good with money and can honestly make me laugh. His weakness is that he talks too much and gets on my nerves. Sometimes he holds things in and then explodes like Mount St. Helens.
 Strength: Ken is very good at getting what he wants. He is also very funny, which will keep up our spirits. Weakness: he can be too pushy, which can backfire. He has a short fuse: little tolerance sometimes.


 My laptop computer and the vibe of NYC.
 My wife and 2 kids (twins 2 1/2 years old).

 Spanish.


 Italy: I imagine great food. Amsterdam: awesome place. Japan.
 Russia, China, Antarctica.

Ken & Tina,"
This married couple is looking to be reconnected on the Race. They've been separated for nine months and living on different coasts and are ready to put their marriage back together.
Ken, an ex-NFL star who played for both the St. Louis Cardinals and the San Diego Chargers, was also a college football assistant coach and is currently a home builder. He is competitive, athletic and believes his problem solving skills will help them win the Race. He thinks Tina is too controlling and should relax a bit more, but anticipates the Race will help them learn to appreciate their differences. His poor choices and infidelity tore their marriage apart and he prays that the Race will help Tina to trust him again.
Tina is a business owner and a CEO. She enjoys meeting new people and experiencing new cultures and believes that everyone has an endearing unique quality about them. She is the brains while Ken is the brawn. She has worked as a Director of Strategic Planning and has launched two successful companies. Tina is also Chairman of the Board of The Children's Cancer Center in Tampa. Tina is driven, athletic and competitive. Both Tina & Ken are Christians and have refocused their lives on building their faithfulness.
Despite their differences, they are still in love and eager to fix their marriage. Both are well traveled and adventurous.[4]

The Amazing Race 12The Amazing Race: Unfinished Business
These best friends have been dating on and off for over three years. These purveyors of Goth pride themselves on keeping Louisville ""weird."" In their own hometown Kynt & Vyxsin are very active in their local scene, regularly hosting and acting as emcee at rock shows and club nights. The most difficult part of the Race will undoubtedly be keeping up their daily ""make up"" routine. Between the two of them Kynt & Vyxsin have collectively had their hair dyed 18 different colors. Fashion is a passion for these two.
Vyxsin claims that the biggest difference between the two is that she is very emotional while he is more reserved. She has been trying to get him to open up more and express his true feelings which she claims she's having success doing. Vyxsin describes herself as compassionate and theatrical and she works as a waiter at Ramsi's Cafe.
Kynt is a waiter at the Texas Roadhouse Restaurant. Kynt describes himself as abstract, atypical and avant-garde He claims that the biggest difference between the two is that Vyxsin is more emotional while Kynt is more sarcastic. Both have also worked as receptionists at Kaleidoscope hair salon for several years.
Together they enjoy shopping, dancing and doing each other's hair/makeup. Besides a mirror Kynt & Vyxsin's favorite thing to stare into is their computer monitor as both are admittedly MySpace-addicts. Additionally they both enjoy roadtripping to Sci-Fi conventions across the country where as Kynt puts it, ""They feel right at home surrounded by Storm Troopers and Wookies."" Both have a dream of someday attending the Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Leipzig, Germany, which is the largest Goth/industrial music festival in the world.

Representing the ""Goth"" community in Louisville has embedded a strong sense of ""us against the world"" mentality in these two Racers. Therefore, don't look for them to fall apart when the chips are down, a trait that will undoubtedly be tested on the Race.[1]

 Season 12/5th place
 My biggest mistake in our previous season was completely burning out the clutch of our car in Italy.
 Arriving at the magical masquerade village in Vilnius, Lithuania. Everyone there was dressed head to toe in mystical costumes. The costumes, the creativity and the decadence reminded me of the Sci-Fi and Comic-Con conventions that Vyxsin and I love to attend every year.
 India, I loved the frenetic energy and cascade of color in every direction. The kaleidoscopic fashion was surreal and the beautiful Indian belly dancers kept my spirits high.
 I lost my dad very suddenly and unexpectedly this year. I want to run the Race as a tribute to him. A victory in this race will give my family some much needed good news.
 Vyxsin and I moved to L.A. and started modeling for our favorite designers.
 Believe it or not, I'm NOT much of an outdoorsman. Before our first season, I had never been camping. It is very difficult to apply eyeliner in a tent. I don't have much interest in ""roughing it"" so to speak.
 I hope to go to the most smoldering and humid Amazon Rainforest because Vyxsin in a pink and black bikini for an entire leg would be great motivation.
 I want to inspire our families. It's been a difficult year and this Race could be the much-needed healing that Vyxsin and I need.
 Housekeeping is not one of Vyxsin's talents. Her house is a disorganized melting pot of garters, glitter and glam rock. I shudder to think about what the inside of her backpack will look like. There is no way I am letting her anywhere near our race fanny pack and passports!
 Go on a vacation!
 We are prepared physically but we need to work on getting our head in the game. We are going to focus more mentally.

 I should have helped Kent get better prepared for stick-shift driving. He burnt the clutch in our vehicle in Italy, which turned out to be a one-way ticket to last place.
 Watching Kent pole vault into a muddy irrigation ditch in Amsterdam. He does not enjoy getting dirty! He looked like a miserable wet kitten as he crawled out of that ditch in his ruined outfit.
 Burkina Faso, Africa, the people were so kind and warm from the moment we stepped off the plane.
 We have suffered the loss of a loved one since our first race. We need an uplifting experience at this point in our lives.
 Our experience on THE AMAZING RACE has opened so many doors for us! We have moved to Los Angeles to pursue our love of fashion, club life and new adventures.
 Dancing, my teammate and my family.
 I feel totally at home in the kitchen. I love to cook vegan food.
 Australia, Kent would look adorable up in a tree cuddling with the koala bears.
 Packing! We carry way too much with us. We need to pack lighter.
 We hope to inspire our families and to reconnect with each other after an extremely difficult year.
 Kent is always ""borrowing"" (i.e. stealing) my eye-pencils and powders. I am constantly chasing him away from my make-up bag.
 If I won the million dollars I would take both of our families on a long vacation.

 We are going to try to form alliances with other teams instead of only focusing on ourselves. Working together with another team or two could propel us all to the final three.[2]

 Program Coordinator
 I coordinate recreational programs and cultural events for the city of Gulfport.
 I am very skilled at the planning and execution of events, activities, etc. I pay very close attention to detail which will help at completing tasks with precision.
 Loquacious, resourceful and driven.
 Running on the beach, organizing (my home, social events, gatherings) and watching reality TV.
 Beyonce – big hair and southern girl flair
 Angelina Jolie.  Stacy is a smoking hot mom! She is a dynamic individual, beautiful, adventurous and has a big heart.  You never know what her next move will be.
 I am a first generation college graduate.  I'm most proud that I was the first person in my family to graduate from college, and I was the first to obtain a masters degree as well.  It was a proud moment for me and my entire family.
 The thought of the unknown scares me. In the U.S. everyone speaks the same language and has the same culture.  It's frightening to imagine stepping off a plane where you can't even ask people questions because they don't speak English.
 It's exciting to get the opportunity to see places that you're only able to see on TV or the internet! Growing up I've been fortunate to travel all over the U.S., but I've never had the opportunity to travel abroad. It will be exciting to experience different customs, foods and ways of life. It's a chance of a lifetime!
 Stacy doesn't assert herself enough.  I want her to give her ideas, thoughts, opinions and not hold back.  I can be very overpowering at times (""mouth of the south""), and I want her to speak up more and not have me do all the talking.
 She's fashionably late to everything.  My super procrastinator cousin always has everyone waiting or her to arrive.  Also, she tends to go off on a tangent with these long, drawn out stories/monologues. I find myself ""listening"" to be polite when I really want to cut her off and start talking myself.
 Brazil/South America, because I think the culture is very exotic and colorful.  I would love to experience ""Carnival"" because it is the birthplace of Mardi Gras, which is a tradition that my family celebrates coming from South Mississippi (near New Orleans).
 We have been separated in our adult lives due to Hurricane Katrina, college, marriage, etc.  We hope to use this time together to strengthen the bond that we once had as children.  Also, I want to take this time to travel, accomplish my goal of winning The Race and to do something adventurous before my husband and I settle down and start having children.

I also spend a lot of time traveling back and forth between the U.S. and Italy, where my husband plays professional basketball for ""Umana Venezia"" in Venice.
 I can multitask easily.  I have developed a lot of skills and resourcefulness throughout the years.
 Analytical, witty and tenacious.
 Spending time/playing with my children, cooking and gaming (Sudoku, Monopoly, Scrabble, Taboo). I'm also very much into politics. My friends often look to me to explain the latest ""possip"" (political-gossip) and hot political topics.
 Jennifer Lopez, because she goes from sweet to heat in 0.2 seconds.
 Kerri is a mix between Beyonce and Tamar Braxton. She is absolutely beautiful, adventurous and intelligent. She's also very talkative. I never know what ""craziness"" will come out of her mouth!
  Other than being a great mommy, I am proud that I was able to complete my MBA with a 4.0 GPA.
Traveling is not really scary to me, however, the thought of being stuck in the middle of nowhere with no means of communication is a bit scary.
 I am excited to see and experience new cultures.
 Kerri has a big mouth and often talks over me.  She also always automatically assumes that her opinion is the only one that counts—or that my opinion isn't important.
 Not only does Kerri speak often but she also speaks very loudly sometimes.  She just wants to be the only voice heard throughout the planet.  She is 100% drama queen.
 I would love to visit Spain – especially Barcelona, mainly because it's a very beautiful country, rich in culture and history.  Plus, I've always wanted to try authentic Spanish food.
 I hope to prove to both of my children, but especially my 11 year old son, that anything is truly possible with hard work and determination. He had speech challenges early on, and would easily get discouraged and very frustrated with his situation. I want him to see me work through challenges with steadfast determination. I hope that in seeing me compete, it will encourage them to dream big and show them that there are no limits to accomplishing one's ambitions. I want them to think to themselves, ""If Mommy can compete for the sky, then we can reach the moon!""

The fraternity brothers from Season 1 are all grown up and married. Kevin & Drew met in a fraternity while attending St. Johns University and immediately hit it off. This high-spirited friendship paved the way for one of the most popular teams in the series' 10 seasons.
After falling short of the million dollars during Season 1, the fraternity brothers took their lovable banter to Discovery Channel's ""Kevin and Drew Unleashed.""
Kevin describes himself as loyal, analytical and outgoing, and has been performing stand-up comedy in New York City for the last three years. Drew describes himself as charismatic and honest. Both are admittedly hard-headed and stubborn which provides a constant stream of bickering between these two.

Although Kevin and Drew are still close, they don't see each other as much as they would like to due to work and family responsibilities. Both are looking forward to traveling the world together again and bringing home the $1 million.[2]

 Getting to see what else is out there and really experiencing life.
 I hope my partner is strong, smart and shares the same passion to run and conquer the Race. Also, I hope he's a dude. I tend to work better with males, especially in competitive situations like the Race, because our level of thinking is similar, to the point and less emotional.
 If they don't share the same drive to win and to travel. Besides that, I'm easy to work with and always take into consideration the other person's perspective/opinions...unless they are dumb, then no. Just kidding!
 Being on the same page. Also anything that may involve being trapped because I'm legit claustrophobic.
 South Africa because I've been DYING to go diving with great white sharks! It's an absolute dream of mine!!!!! They are my favorite animals and I swear I probably was a great white in my past life...

 Sisters
These two former Division 1 College athletes look forward to becoming the first ever all female Team to win the Race. Besides athleticism, these sisters have little in common. 
LaKisha works as a youth program coordinator and basketball coach. She hopes the same strengths that make her a good coach – patience and a strong competitive nature - will ultimately make her the best Racer the game has seen. Meanwhile, she claims her sister is very impatient and blunt when it comes to dealing with others or speaking her mind. 
Jennifer works as a marketing assistant and newsletter coordinator for an assisted living company. She claims that she is the creative one while LaKisha is the analytical one…two traits that will undoubtedly be tested on the Race. Jennifer is infectiously energetic and confident, played college volleyball at the University of Louisville. LaKisha played basketball for the same school. Both have a competitive drive and are eager to put it to the test against this season's crop of Racers. 

Neither sister has traveled extensively outside of the states, but they are looking forward to embarking on this journey of a lifetime together in order to change that. They will run the Race with unstoppable speed and numerous arguments along the way.[1]

 Knowing that the entire race brought a clearer understanding of who my sister is and her mood. Also, visiting Thailand and the Phuket Zoo was very memorable.
 It's a toss up between Thailand and India. The people seemed so free and happy with what they had.
 I want redemption, I want to win and I want to see more areas of the world I wouldn't get to see otherwise.
 I've slowed down and instead of just doing and thinking later, I think more strategically.
 I'm passionate about motivating and pushing people to accomplish things they think they can't. That's why I love coaching.
 My guilty pleasure is all the Housewives shows on Bravo!

BioBefore the Race
Kris and Jon are dating long-distance between Long Beach, California and Scottsdale, Arizona, respectively. They met in Scottsdale on Kris's 30th birthday, when Jon was tending bar at the club where she was celebrating. They've been passionately in love ever since, but his career (he is part owner of the club) and her responsibilities at school have kept them in a long-distance relationship.
Kris once worked as a go-go dancer in a nightclub, but now she is a cocktail waitress and studying geography in her senior year at UCLA. She describes herself as ""animated and spontaneous."" Her hobbies are snowboarding, beach volleyball and golf.
Jon is a ""working partner"" in a nightclub in Scottsdale, Arizona. He believes he is a ""passionate and determined"" person, and his favorite hobbies are snowboarding, surfing and water polo. He's a member of the Arizona Masters Water Polo team.

Kris & Jon are hoping that doing the Race together will show them if their relationship can work on a 24/7 basis, and if they should put an end to the long-distance part of their relationship.[1]


 Not too extensive. I have traveled mostly to countries and places where you could get by with English and a little of the native language.
 My previous travel experience has consisted of seeing most of the major metropolitan capitals within the US, travel through Mexican destination cities with extensive visits to Cabo San Lucas, and travel through most of Western Europe.


 The most stressful aspect of traveling for me is actually getting to the airport on time. Once I am on my way, I make it a point not to let myself get stressed out. I'm on vacation, right?
 The most stressful aspect of traveling is waiting in lines.


 Travel and competition are my two favorite things! I could not imagine a better experience. I get to travel around the world, and if I do really well, somebody wants to give me a million dollars. Hmmm…
 I want to be on THE AMAZING RACE to have the opportunity to discover new countries, face extreme challenges, and push my physical and mental limits.


 Jon and I have only traveled together to domestic destinations, like Las Vegas. We have a great time together. However, we are so much alike that it is like we have traveled together a million times before.
 Kris and I have traveled together within the US. Our last trip was to Las Vegas, and we had an excellent time. Imagine that! We are very compatible when it comes to travel, and we are excited to see and experience new adventures together.


 The thing I fear most is being eliminated first. I know we have the ability to do very well, but this Race has a lot to do with luck, too. I would hate to make a simple mistake and have that cost us the Race and/or the chance of making it to another country.
 The only fear I have at this point in competing in THE AMAZING RACE is being eliminated first. If we can get past the first Pit Stop, I know we can go a long way.


 I think that I bring patience and a thorough thought process. I will be the teammate who will pay attention to the little details (my hopes, anyway). I am also very competitive and feel that I can hold my own in any situation. It is hard to admit to weaknesses when competing against 10 other strong Teams, but I have to be forthcoming and say that my biggest weakness is that I get frustrated when things aren't going my way. This could be a huge weakness in this Race, especially if I am so frustrated that I can't think straight.
 I feel the strengths that I bring to our Team are a positive and competitive attitude as well as physical strength and endurance. My weakness lies within my eagerness to succeed and not always paying attention to the minor details.


 Jon is extremely strong and just a competitive as I am. He will bring our Team speed and endurance. Jon's other strengths are that he stays relatively calm in situations and is very intelligent. He also brings me strength. What can I say, I can find no weaknesses in my man. He is just simply badass!
 Kris is an extremely competitive and wise teammate. She has a keen sense and a great ability to pay attention to detail. I still have found no weakness within her!


 I will really miss having music around all the time as well as a reliable hot shower. There really won't be time to ""look your best,"" which is sad considering this is national television, but on the other hand, we are here to win a race, not a beauty pageant!
 I will miss my home-cooked meals and warm showers from home.


 I speak English, and that is pretty much it. I took French in college, but only the required amount so, needless to say, my French is very limited!
 I speak English and Spanglish.


 Honestly, I am hoping to visit places I have not or would not consider visiting on my own. I hope we go to crazy places that will truly be an insane experience!
 I am excited to see any new destinations. I have always been intrigued and interested in visiting Iceland, though my preference in a destination is usually sunny and with a beach.


 I feel best prepared for any country that speaks English. You know, like Canada, England and, oh yes, even Belize! I'm afraid that beyond that, I'm not really that prepared, especially in the language department. But make no mistake: I'm not afraid of a little challenge, either!
 I feel most prepared for England, being that I have visited several times and have a bearing on the cities and transit. Needless to say, I'm ready for anything, so bring it on![2]

 As a professional skier I formerly competed intensely on the world stage in halfpipe skiing. I now create content (video, photo, and written word) to share the power that outdoor adventure can have in one's life. It's time spent outdoors, pursuing new challenges, that teaches me about this world and helps me be a better person. I also help various publishing entities make money through referral-based advertising (that's technically my day job now!).
 Indomitable, intelligent, competitive, and empathetic.
 Skiing, writing, mountain biking, and coaching.
 I am most proud of my impenetrable mind. Coming back from numerous injuries to continue my pursuits in skiing, I was able to return strong and have big wins after some pretty major knee injuries.
 Not being able to communicate effectively to get where we're trying to go. Also, potentially getting sick from food and/or water.
 Seeing the different ways that people go about their daily lives, immersing myself in someone else's culture, realizing how BIG the world truly is, and experiencing new cuisine!
 I would most like to visit Southeast Asia (Vietnam or Thailand)—it's an area of the world that I've never been able to visit. The mountains and hills look breathtaking and the architecture is majestic. Most of my travels have taken me to snow-capped mountains, so traveling to a warmer climate would be a nice change of pace!
 Besides winning, I hope to reignite my inner competitor, to fight hard for something again, and to work as a team toward a common goal! My competitive ski career ended short because of injury and I left some things on the table—I don't want to let that happen ever again!

Lake & Michelle,"
Lake & Michelle are a close-knit married couple from Hattiesburg, Mississippi. They met as freshmen in college and have been married for 13 years.
Lake is a dentist who has limited traveling experience outside of the United States. While he describes himself as energetic and motivated, Michelle notes that he's your typical Type A personality, very impatient and always looking for ways to do it better.
Michelle is a stay-at-home mother of three who works part-time in Lake's office. She claims that she's much more laid back than her husband and hopes this won't cause friction between the two while taking part on THE AMAZING RACE. Michelle sees herself as being loyal, kind and loving and is running the Race to prove to herself and Lake that she's capable of accomplishing things.
While Lake & Michelle are both aware of their personality differences, they feel they work well together and hope their differences will actually help them as they travel the world on the Race.[1]

Lance and Keri have been dating each other for over two years. Lance proposed this winter, and the two are planning to be married soon. Both are looking to the Race to test their relationship, communication skills and their physical breaking points.
Lance and Keri are very athletic, love animals and the outdoors. Some of their fondest memories include recent vacations in Jamaica and the Dominican Republic, and they are now looking forward to traveling around the world together.
Lance, a self-made trial attorney and black belt in karate, has an über-aggressive personality and is admittedly confrontational — he describes himself as having a ""street persona"" and will do whatever it takes to win. Keri is a health care finance manager and while she likes to take the kinder and gentler approach to dealing with certain situations, she admits that she is equally as competitive.
Keri's hobbies include jogging, jet skiing and shopping. Lance's hobbies include karate, weight training, and following the Red Sox, Patriots, and Celtics.
Lance loves the competition aspect of the Race and Keri loves to travel. Both are eager to compete and put their relationship through the rigors of the Race. They have not lived together around the clock before, or necessarily had to work as a team… and believe this experience will be good practice for the rest of their lives together.[1]

Lena & Kristy,"


BioBefore the race
Lena & Kristy are sisters who grew up in Utah. In the Fall, Kristy will be starting her last year of college at University of Utah. She is the single mother of an eight-year-old daughter, Madison. She recently took a few months off from school to move to Denmark with her daughter.
Lena is a student and former striptease aerobics instructor. She also put college on hold so she could travel abroad, but is planning to return to school after the Race. She describes herself as outgoing, happy and competitive.
Most of the time the sisters get along very well; however, they agree that getting into a fist fight a few years back was a low point in their relationship. One of the most special times they had as sisters was living together in Las Vegas.

Being a young single mother, Kristy's motivation for being on THE AMAZING RACE is to enjoy this experience to the fullest and do all the things she has never been able to do, while Lena wants to win the $1 million.[1]


 Since a child, I have traveled a lot. My mother is from Denmark, so as a toddler I lived there for a while, as well as extensive traveling all throughout Europe as a child and an adult. I have lived in Japan and traveled to parts of Asia and Australia, and all over the US.
 I have spent the last couple of years traveling quite a bit. I lived in Copenhagen, Denmark for a few months, and have visited interesting places like Thailand. My traveling opportunities are somewhat limited, due to the fact that I am a single mother and usually bring my daughter with me. I have also traveled extensively throughout the US.


 I have never really had a stressful moment in traveling, except missing flights.
 Wondering if you've remembered everything you needed to pack. I can't stand layovers and waiting in the airport for hours; it's so unproductive.


 To experience traveling the world in a way I never have. To do something so unique with my sis. A great way for us to spend time together after not seeing each other for a while.
 I hope to be an example and show the world that Mormons, Utahans and women can be interesting, exciting and capable of competing in high-stress situations while maintaining core values. Traveling always opens my mind to different issues facing foreign cultures. Some of my most life-changing and character-building experiences have come from traveling to unfamiliar places.


 Only on family vacations, never alone.
 Lena and I haven't traveled very much as adults together, but have been on countless family road trips and vacations as children. I am anxious, and a bit worried, about what we might discover about each other now that we are adults. It's been at least a year since I have spent time with Lena, and I have never been forced to share time and space with anyone other than my daughter, especially someone who is my opposite.


 I don't camp; I don't carry backpacks or carry my own luggage. Those are things I just don't do. So that is probably the thing I am most afraid of. Also I like to dress up. I like my heels and bags. I like being a girl and dressing up. So the whole not showering thing will probably be difficult for me.
 I do not want to ice climb or bungee jump, but would force myself if it came up. I will leave the eating to Lena; my stomach hasn't been very experimental. My biggest emotional fear is that I will miss my daughter too much and become depressed. I have never left her for more than a few days at a time.


 Well, I think I am pretty easy going and positive. I am very mentally and emotionally strong, so I am sure that I won't ever freak out or anything. I sometimes make decisions without thinking them all the way through, which could be a problem. But really I have no clue. Everything changes when you're under pressure or in extreme situations.
 I am sometimes impatient and need my own space (which I will never get on the Race). I am also critical of myself. I am very competitive, strong, organized, task-oriented, detail-oriented, pragmatic, logical and emotionally controlled, yet I can still appear kind and non-threatening.


 Kristy is very organized. She is also very thorough. She is very strong mentally as well as physically. So she motivates me in a way that no one else does.
 Lena is very social, bubbly, determined, athletic, strong, and will keep our spirits up. She will probably be the social half of the Team. She is good at getting what she wants. Lena's desire to be social sometimes means she isn't thorough. She can be flighty at times, although that is what makes her sweet and fun. She is not very detail-oriented.


Friends, computer, cell phone, car, credit cards. Wow, now doesn't that sound horrible?
 My daughter, my laptop, my down comforter from Denmark and my indie music.


 I pretend to speak a few languages: Japanese, German, Spanish and Danish. Basically I know enough to get by.
 I can speak a little Danish. I also speak British and Australian. Only joking!


 Iceland!
 I would absolutely flip if we went to Iceland, New Zealand or Africa


 Japan and Denmark.
 Denmark and Scandinavia.[2]

 I'm most proud of writing and defending my poetry thesis (a.k.a. a freaking poetry book!) when I got my MFA… all while also working to co-found my MFA program's literary magazine. It was a really difficult time because I was trying to finish school and my dad was very sick.
 As a woman, I'm scared about being harassed because I'm viewed as not being able to defend myself.
 I know this is what everybody probably says, but I'm really excited to see new places and experience new cultures! As a poet, it's the little things; when I was in Ireland, I still remember learning that there are over 30 words for ""green"" in Gaelic.
 I spent eight hours alone in Helsinki when I was 20 and absolutely loved, loved, loved it. I felt somehow connected to the city. Take me back, Phil!
 I hope to gain a deeper trust and better understanding of Leo, especially in high-stress situations. My trust in myself can falter, and I want to see how much I can rely on him. We are great complements to each other, great partners, and, yeah, I want to test that.

 Season 23
 Founder/Owner of New York Deli & The Speakeasy
 I am a restaurateur and in the business of making sure people are never hungry and never thirsty.
 By far the biggest mistake I made was during the leg in Japan while I was constructing the robot. We had just gone from being last in the previous leg to first in Japan. I finished the robot before the other three teams but when I was putting the arms in the torso, I accidentally turned them around and by the time I figured out what I had done wrong, the other three teams had finished and we were eliminated.
 The most memorable part of season 23 was definitely the leg in Indonesia while I was constructing the angklung with all the students. For a brief moment, it put the race on pause for me and it felt like I was back in school. I wasn't in a hurry to complete the road block, I just wanted to enjoy the moment and entertain all the students. With all the good energy we received from the students, we ending up finishing the roadblock first and coming in first place! I'm actually starting an angklung store here in Los Angeles now, haha!
 My favorite place I visited in my first season was between Lisbon and Abu Dhabi. The history and people in Lisbon were amazing, and I could definitely see myself living there. On the other hand seeing the amazing advances, buildings, and technology in Abu Dhabi was breathtaking. Not only were those places great places to visit, they were also the places we had the most fun in!
 I want to run the race again because I have to redeem myself. Jamal and I are so competitive in our day to day lives, it was so hard to go all the way to the end, and to go out the way we did. It's almost like making it to the Superbowl and missing the game winning field goal. We hate losing, and we lost in the most upsetting way. Not to mention it's an experience of a lifetime, and to be given the opportunity to do again is amazing, I cannot wait to interact with all the different cultures, visit more amazing countries, and drop a dash of the ""afghanimal"" spirit everywhere we go!
 I've been the same ever since I was born, however this time around I am more knowledgeable about how the race is run, how to interact with the different team members and I know how to build a robot.
 I am passionate about traveling, cooking, friends, family, being active, film, sports, fashion, business, and being entrepreneurial and coming up with new and innovative ideas. My brain never seems to stop working.
 People would be surprised to learn how humorous and genuine we are. I love to live life to the fullest and want to show the world and everyone we interact with that, yes, we are running the most competitive race in the world, but at the same time, we're staying true to our roots and not losing focus on what makes us who we are. Expect lots of fun, out of the ordinary, entertaining from the ""afghanimals!""
 The biggest challenge Jamal and I will face is communicating with one another. Communication is key to every healthy relationship, whether it be between a husband and wife, coach and player or two cousins racing around the world. We are definitely communicating better every day, but since we are both so aggressive and competitive sometimes we can bump heads, but we get over it really fast.
 My biggest pet peeve about my cousin is the fact that sometimes he doesn't listen. We both are hard headed and we both want to do things our own way. But we are a team, and compromises have to be made.
 I would love to visit Spain! The way of life in Spain is something that I can relate to and I could see myself living there in the near future. The people there are some of the nicest people I have ever met, and I also speak Spanish so that would help!
 I hope to finish the Race. We came so close last time. I hate not finishing something that I start, and to be given another opportunity to run the Race is a blessing. This time I'm going to finish and hopefully at the same time, entertain the entire world!
 This time around we will be a little more careful of what we say and who we say it to. We want to make sure everyone gets to know us first before we start racing and becoming super competitive. Plus, we do not want to get u-turned twice again. In the beginning of our last season, we were unfortunately portrayed as being sneaky and manipulative, which wasn't the case. Certain teams didn't understand our humor and how we were running the race.

 Showing our competitiveness to other teams, making us the biggest threat of the race.
 The first-hand experience of racing around the world and interacting with different people and their cultures.
 Austria and Portugal are at the top of my list of favorite places because of how beautiful the cities looked as we were racing. They're both so rich in history, and definitely places I would want to visit in the future with my wife.
 I feel like we have some unfinished business to take care of. The way we went out the last race was kind of unfair and out of our hands.
 Nothing much has changed! We're still crazy, funny, cool guys who enjoy life!
 I'm very passionate about winning and trying not to make any mental mistakes.
 That I can speak four different languages and used to be a linguist. So picking up new languages in a new country in a very short time shouldn't be too hard!
 The other competitors on the Race. Some are back for the 3rd time and there is no team we will take for granted.
 He can be sensitive to criticism and at times can be stubborn.
 I would like to visit some African nation with all wild animals. To have any challenge where we interact with animals is always fun. Also, I love lions, tigers and bears … Oh My!!

 I want to be able to say that competing with the best of the best was challenging, but I was able to perform and bring my ""A"" game! Any strategic changes you will make heading into this Race: I am going to try not to be such a big target to other teams and take it easy so we aren't shown as threats to the race.

 Patience. I would 100% say patience. As long as you have patience, and you sit there, you take some deep breaths, think it through. You have all the tools to succeed. As long as you're resourceful enough, to an extent, you use a little bit of common sense, but primarily patience, I think you're gonna succeed.
 I love that one. I mean, patience with each other, and patience with a task. Personally, I also think composure probably will play hand in hand.
 We can kind of tie it together.
 You're gonna be doing a lot of stressful things. Everything you're doing: The challenges, the tasks, the navigating, the reading, the thinking, the focusing, is all going to need to be done with composure, and then focus. So if you're too easily flustered and you give into your own thoughts, and you allow your head to take you on its own journey of overthinking, they can take you in the wrong spot. So I think, composure and patience.
 I mean, I absolutely love that he brought up patience with one another. That's so huge. I mean, you see, in past seasons, other teams, they don't have patience with one another.
 It can make or break you.
 Exactly. I mean, how far do those teams go, right? If you have patience with one another, just go out there and have fun. It's a fun thing to do!
 And have fun with each other! You're here to grow together as a team; you're here to grow individually. So take it as it is. Take every task and every challenge that comes as what it is and move past it. Don't get so wound up thinking about, ""What's going to happen tomorrow, or on the next leg?"" What's in front of you is what you need to do and you move on past that.
 Be present. I mean, these challenges, these activities, they can be difficult. But they're not just difficult for you. They're difficult for both of y'all! Yeah, it's gonna be hard for him just like it's hard for me. I think knowing that and just having patience and all that good stuff with one another, it's gonna take you a long way.

 We've known each other basically all of our lives and I would see him from time to time because our older sisters were on the same cheerleading squad, but did not start actually communicating until I got to high school. Just about every day of my freshman year, before homeroom, CJ would run by my locker just as I would get it open and slam it closed. This would make me soooo mad because it always took me forever to get it open and he knew that my homeroom teacher, mean Mrs. Philpot, would lock us out after the late bell rang. My mother said my father did the same thing to her when they were in high school.

 I would have to say that C.J. reminds me of Deion Sanders (not the cheating, crazy part), but the fact that he is such a manly man, has traditional values, is a great father and is a real entrepreneur.
 Nothing
 Everything about traveling excites me, from going somewhere I have never been before to going somewhere that I have been a thousand and one times. Just escaping from everyday life is a plus.
 He always misinterprets what and how I say things. He always thinks I'm trying to be mean or facetious when I have no malicious intent. Hopefully by going through this experience he will see that I always have his best interest at heart and would never try to intentionally hurt him.
 It works my nerve every time he says ""do you not see what I'm sayin?"" He feels the need to say this every single time he says something. It drives me crazy.
 I have always wanted to visit Libya in Africa because I am named after it!!! (My parents just changed the ""I"" to an ""E."" I know you were probably wondering how to pronounce it.) C.J. constantly reminds me that my name is spelled wrong.
 Because we have been together for so long and know each other very well, I think it is time for us to get married!!! We are at the stage in our relationship where that is the natural next step. He is already an important part of my family and vice versa. I just do not know what is holding him back. I constantly ask him when he's gonna propose and the answer is always ""when the Lord tells me to."" My hope is that from participating in and winning ""The Amazing Race,"" he finally sees that there is no better life partner than ME!!
 The race could change so much. Hopefully we'll do very well and win and I'll get my ring!

A major accomplishment for them was winning the California State Bowling Doubles Tournament in 1999. In addition to bowling, they go on family vacations together to Bass Lake in California.
Karen has been happily married for 21 years and has three children. Linda is celebrating her silver anniversary with her husband this year. She is also a mother of three children and teaches tennis.

Linda & Karen describe themselves as ""athletic moms who like to compete at everything."" They are excited to compete in THE AMAZING RACE 5 so they can see new places and meet new people.[1]

 Karen and I met 15 years ago at Kindergarten Roundup for our sons, who are now 19 years old.

 Our relationship is primarily based on our bowling competitions.

 We vacation each year at Bass Lake, California, and we travel to National and State Bowling tournaments.

 Karen is the second most competitive person I know—me being #1!

 No change.

 Mentally I am the strongest, but I tend to
whine when in last place.


 Karen is very athletic and competitive. She never gives up. She believes everything has to be perfect.[2]

Linz Family,"
The Linz family is from Cincinnati, Ohio. This close-knit team is comprised of three brothers and one feisty sister who are so deeply rooted in Cincinnati that they have over 50 first cousins living in or near the Cincinnati area. The Linz's parents have been married for over 28 years.

Megan, 21, is the only female on the team. She also attends Miami University of Ohio and is studying Strategic Communications. Megan enjoys cheerleading and field hockey. Although she's outnumbered by the boys, she and her brothers are very close.
The Linz siblings are well-traveled, athletic, very competitive and ready to embark on a race around the world.[1]
"
Lisa & Joni,"
Lisa & Joni are sisters who have lived apart from one another for almost 20 years. After their father passed away, Joni opted to stay in Texas with their mom, while Lisa moved to Florida. The sisters hope their experience on THE AMAZING RACE will help them to reconnect with one another and make up for lost time.
Lisa, who lives in Santa Rosa Beach, Florida, is a mother of two and has been married for seven years. Several years ago, Lisa accomplished her longtime goal of opening her own art gallery. She's an avid artist who enjoys anything creative and describes herself as smart, determined and competitive.
Joni, who resides in Katy, Texas, is also the mother of two and has been married for 10 years. She has never traveled outside of the United States and is quite eager to see what the world has to offer. Funny and headstrong, Joni claims to be a people person who is much more patient than her teammate.
This outgoing twosome are loud, rambunctious, and each stand over six feet tall. If they win the $1 million prize, both Lisa & Joni admit that they would like to get some plastic surgery.[1][2]

 Sister
 Real Estate Agent
 I sell Real Estate in Miami along with my sister. We work 24/7 and sell a high volume of homes in Miami and have to deal with all different cultures and personalities.
 Competitive, loud/outspoken and funny.
 Working out, diving and running.
 In the last 6–7 years I have been able to create one of the top 10 real estate teams in Florida. Last year we sold more homes than any other agent in South Florida (and there are 24,000 agents in Miami).
 Barbie (the Real Estate version).
 Blake Lively.
 Language barriers and getting sick.
 Seeing the world! I have been trapped in a Miami office selling everyone else the dream. I want to see all the different cultures, places and learn new things.
 It could bring us closer together and get us away from the office as we are always working. This experience would allow us the opportunity to separate work from our personal lives and concentrate on our bond together.
 She is extremely stubborn.
 Africa. I want to go on a safari and also swim with great white sharks. I think Africa is very different from Miami and it would be a great place to explore and see wildlife and the different cultures.
 My sister and I work so hard and have spent the last seven years building this incredible business that we are very successful at, but it has left us with little personal life and I would like to take time to travel and spend quality time together. I recently got married and before I start to have a family, I would like to have this one last challenge with my sister.

 Kate Hudson from ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.""
 Barbie
 I'm picky with what I eat so having to eat weird things.
 Everything! I love new experiences.
 Decision making. We both think we can do everything.
 Lisa talks SO LOUDLY and most of the time it is hard to get a word in...We just end up talking over each other.
 Australia. I would love to go great white shark diving.
 Ah! I hope to gain memories with my sister. We work so hard it will be nice to have the time to travel with her. She recently got married and I am not sure how many more ""sister trips"" we can get away with.

 I have no fears. The worst thing has already happened to me, the passing of my Dad.
 I love experiencing new things, different cultures and the different ways people live has always been a curiosity of mine.
 We are so close that we tend to pick out each other's faults. We need to work on not fighting so much.
 She is very bossy and tells me what to do all the time. Plus, she always thinks she's right.
 I have always wanted to go to South Africa. I've heard it is a beautiful place.
 I hope that we stop bickering so much and learn to deal with each other's faults.

 I hope to gain more of an understanding of how my twin operates, and how the heck we are going to function as a team in The Race.

 Maryville, Mo.
 Auctioneer
 I BID 20 NOW 25! I am an auctioneer! I have grown up in the auction profession since I was 6 years old, when I sold my first item! I am a 5th generation auctioneer in my family. I own my own auction company, Liz Espey Auctions, in Maryville, Mo., where I specialize in Antique, Machinery, Real Estate, Business Liquidations and Personal Property Auctions, just to name a few!
 Confident, sassy, and firecracker! They don't call me Firecracker for nothing!
 My favorite hobbies are horseback riding, spending time with my two Australian Shepherds, Trixie and Texas, out on the farm, and working closely with my father on auctions.
 The accomplishment that I am most proud of is graduating from the World Wide College of Auctioneering (WWCA) in Mason City, Iowa and following in my family's footsteps in becoming a fifth generation auctioneer!
 The one thing that really scares me about traveling is not knowing where we are going. I would have to say the fear of the unknown is what really scares me the most.
 What really excites me the most about traveling is getting to see the world! I travel a little for work, but nothing like this Race has to offer! I can't wait to see what the world really has to offer! I can't wait to see what the world is like out of Missouri!
 I hope my partner is good at decision making, has a good sense of direction and doesn't have a weak personality. I like to joke and have fun! What fun is it if you get paired up with a stick in the mud? I like someone who is outgoing and isn't afraid to get dirty or break a nail!
 Some of the qualities that would make it hard for me to deal with in a partner would be if we both think we are right about directions and we end up fighting over it. I'm not a big fighter, but when I know I'm right about something I stick to my guns and don't back down! I have a big personality and I hope they do too! I don't want to be paired up with someone who is afraid to get dirty or can't keep up with the pace of the race.
 I think that the biggest challenge we will face as a team would be directions in a foreign country. I have never been out of the country and I don't know what to expect! Also, I hope they don't have a hard time keeping up with me because sometimes it's like trying to catch a tiger by the tail!
 The one country that I would want to visit is Italy! It has been on my bucket list to eat a plate of real Italian spaghetti there!
 Aside from winning The Race, I want to gain a new respect for what I take for granted every day. Being able to wake up and do what you love is a gift that too many of us take for granted. You have to live every day like it's your last! I can only imagine what the show has in store for all of us so BRING IT ON! I can't wait to share this experience with the cast this season![1]

 Pittsburgh, Penn.
 Butcher
 I own and operate an old times butcher shop in the Lawrenceville neighborhood of Pittsburgh. We specialize in locally sourced and ethically raised meats. We make everything on site, including bacon and our famous kielbasa.
 Fun, driven and kind.
 Fishing, camping, brewing beer, playing in my band, playing and watching ice hockey and, most importantly, hanging out with my wife and daughter.
 My 6-year-old daughter is kind, smart and polite.
 I am not crazy about super long flights.
 The food!
 The ability to read a map, a good sense of direction and preferably bilingual.
 High maintenance, non-appreciative of the opportunity we have, and rude and ignorant to other cultures.
 The fact that we are complete strangers.
 I honestly cannot answer that. I want to see the whole world.
 I hope to make my daughter proud of me.[2]

Logan & Chris,"[1]
Logan[] 36
 Miami, Fla.
 Dating/business partner
 Paparazzi photographer
 I locate celebrities as they visit South Florida and photograph them candidly, usually on the beach. We also shoot video coverage, sometimes asking questions.
 Creative, strong-willed and cute.
 Snorkeling and underwater photography, paddle boarding in my backyard canals and beach, going to art museums and traveling.
 Working hard and being able to save up and buy a condo, and some of the big trips I've done with Chris
 I don't know who reminds me of myself but I'd like to be as cool and stylish as Gwen Stefani or as happy-go-lucky as Miley Cyrus. But I'm not really like either of them. I see myself as that cynical cartoon girl Daria from MTV.
 Maybe a young Patrick Swayze or the Tasmanian Devil because he is like a bull in a china shop most of the time.
 Small planes, like really tiny 6-seater planes, and getting traveler's diarrhea.
 Waking up in new places, learning languages, trying food, seeing beautiful old cities and amazing natural wonders. Traveling is my favorite thing to do!
 I hope we can figure out how to not get frustrated with each other, how to listen and let each other talk, and how to forgive and not place blame on the other person.
 He interrupts and talks over me which is rude and that also means he's not listening.
 Norway to see the Northern Lights and Germany for the contemporary arts scene. Also Australia and New Zealand for the natural beauty, Hawaii for snorkeling, Vietnam and Laos for the adventure, and Cuba for the photographic opportunities.
 If we can accomplish these tasks without killing each other, maybe we can consider taking our relationship to the next level. If we self-destruct on national television, it might be a sign that it's not going to work at all anymore.

Chris[] 46
 Miami, Fla.
 Dating/business partner
 Paparazzi photographer
 I photograph/video celebrities or people in the news then send images to agency for worldwide distribution.
 Competitive, creative and assertive.
 Music research/appreciation, collector of vintage mid-century modern objects/arts/furniture and photography.
 Raising my son, Matthew, as a young parent at 17 years old. Matthew is 28 years old, graduated from MIT and is successfully working for a start-up in San Francisco.
 Somewhere between Jeff Bridges and Bo Bridges.
 Logan looks like Amanda Peet and acts like Grumpy cat.
 I've never been scared of traveling but if I had to list something, I would say public transportation in lesser developed countries.
 Learning about new cultures, meeting different people and without sounding corny, finding beauty in the unexpected.
 Logan doesn't like to be told what to do. She is constantly telling me what to do, but is unwilling to take recommendations or instructions in return.
 When things don't go well, it turns into the blame game. It has to be someone's fault.
 Jordan/Israel/Egypt- I fell in love with the desert in Morocco and because it is getting more and more difficult to travel to that region. Also, Cuba because I grew up in Miami.
 I would like for us to overcome some of the hurdles in our relationship-issues that arise when working together. We need to find better ways to deal with stress- either strengthen us as a couple or accept there are problems we can't overcome.

 Street Artist
 I am a street artist and entrepreneur living in Brooklyn, N.Y. Everything I create is crocheted and made of yarn. I work with big brands and companies around the world. I have crocheted everything from a school bus in a national Gap commercial to the largest crochet billboard in Times Square!
 Adventurous, creative and positive.
 Crochet and ballet.
 I am the most proud of the crochet billboard I created in Time Square for Miller Lite Beer. It was 50 feet by 25 feet and I only had three weeks to get it done!
 What scares me about traveling is getting lost in a city where I do not speak the language.
 I am most excited to travel and completely immerse myself into the world around me.
 I hope my partner is easy to get along with, strong and, most importantly, drives a stick shift.
 I will not be able to put up with any drama. Please no crying.
 I think the biggest challenge we will face is learning how to work together on the fly.
 I would like to visit Cuba. I love all of the bright colors and art!
 I hope to accomplish a greater understanding of people around the world. I am excited to learn from everyone I meet and get to know what everyday life is like thousands of miles away from home.[1]

 Orthopedic Device Representative
 Provide technical product and procedural support to surgeons and hospital staff during orthopedic surgery.
 Determined, gregarious and principled.
 Olympic weightlifting, hiking, CrossFit, fishing and socializing.
 Making my family proud by creating my own path in life and enjoying each day to the fullest.
 Having never traveled outside of the United States, my biggest fear is being ignorant to the cultures and customs of other countries I visit and offending anyone.
 Learning about life in other parts of the world and immersing myself in the cultures that I've never experienced before!
 Positive, confident, level-headed, physically fit and no ego.
 Self-absorbed, unappreciative, melodramatic and out of shape.
 The biggest challenge will be facing the unknowns of the race without being familiar with each other's personalities.
 I would love to visit Ireland or Fiji! Both places are uniquely beautiful and completely different than anywhere I've visit before.
 Finishing the race is my biggest goal because it means I'll have made it around the world in my first venture outside of the U.S., and I hope to make lifelong friends along the way![2]

Lorena & Jason,"
This couple met at a bar over three years ago, quickly started dating and have been trying to figure out if they really belong together ever since. Although they live under one roof, they rarely see each other due to their opposite work schedules.
Lorena and Jason's cultural differences has caused some issues in their relationship and they're hoping the Race might help them figure out whether or not their relationship has what it takes to last.
Jason works as a wedding videographer/actor and teaches martial arts. His favorite hobbies are yoga, rock climbing and martial arts. He describes himself as courageous and volatile. Volatile could also be the best word to describe his and Lorena's relationship. Lorena admits that she is a very jealous person, which has caused problems in the past.
Lorena also works as a waitress and is an actress. She admits that the biggest difference between the two is that she stresses out over everything while Jason is much more relaxed. Lorena is ready to get married and this topic in particular has caused some friction in their relationship in the past.
Both are well traveled and very physical. This couple plays together, travels together, exercises together and fights together.[1]
"
Lori & Bolo,"
Lori & Bolo reside in the small country town of Molino, Florida and have been together for eight years. Bolo is a professional wrestler and Lori is a barrel horse racer.
Throughout the years, Lori spent time watching Bolo train for wrestling and decided that she could also do it and jumped in the ring. Although she has worked as a professional wrestler, she is now concentrating on horse racing and hopes to compete in professional rodeos in the near future. Bolo describes his wife as a mix between Jennifer Aniston and professional wrestler Chyna.
Bolo's military service and wrestling career has allowed him to travel abroad, but Lori has never been out of the United States and looks forward leaving her small community and seeing the world. When asked what three adjectives best describe themselves, both Bolo and Lori said the same thing: hard working, honest and great personality.
Although they don't have any children, they consider their eight dogs their kids. They love animals and have rescued many stray dogs. Their primary motivation for going on THE AMAZING RACE is to leave their small town to experience different people and cultures around the world.[1]

They hope the Race will reinforce the strengths of their relationship and identify potential areas of conflict.
Both are exceptionally fit, have great people skills and a high energy level. Marcy is not your typical 60-year-old; she attends flying trapeze classes, studies Kung Fu and rock climbs with Ron. To keep pace with Marcy, Ron is in the gym lifting weights, running, swimming or kickboxing. After being selected for the Race, he found a new physical challenge in a course that allowed him to confront his fears of heights.
Marcy is a nationally recognized advertising photographer, while Ron spends his mornings as a high-volume day trader and his afternoons as a math tutor. They both have traveled extensively and Marcy speaks several languages. Ron is personable and extroverted. Trained as a lawyer, he is cautious and likes to take his time to think things through while Marcy is spontaneous, impulsive and easily distracted. Marcy finds balance in Ron's pragmatism and calmness. While he likes to process his thoughts, she prefers to tackle problems head-on.

 Mother/Son
This mother/son team is determined to show the world that nothing can stop them from living out their dreams. They enjoy hiking and traveling together and share a strong bond. Luke has been deaf since birth and Margie became his link to the hearing world. He uses American Sign Language to communicate. 
Luke and his mother have developed their own short hand sign language and the ability to almost read each other's mind – an ability that will undoubtedly come in handy on the road. One of the most moving moments they shared was when Luke surprised his mother by delivering a valedictorian speech at his graduation ceremony from Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind. 
Margie is looking at this experience as a great opportunity to spend quality time with her son. She describes herself as competitive and a little controlling, but in a good way. She is willing to go anywhere the Race takes her and isn't afraid of adventure. She enjoys hiking and running while Luke also enjoys hiking and biking. Luke describes himself as talkative, determined and adventurous. 
Luke hopes to be a role-model for deaf people everywhere while proving that the deaf can do just about anything and to never think otherwise. He believes his knowledge on the topic of anything and everything Race related - he's one of the biggest fans of the show ever - will help his team win. 

Margie and Luke are excited to see new places, experience new foods and learn about different cultures – all the while fulfilling a shared dream – to compete and win ""The Amazing Race.""[1]

 Season 14/3rd place
 Not drinking enough water and becoming dehydrated in Thailand. I fainted.
 Finishing in first place for the first leg of the Race.
 Thailand, it was number one on my wish list for Season 14 so getting to go to both Bangkok and Phuket was fantastic.
 It was one of the most exciting and best experiences of my life. I am looking forward to all the new places we will go.
 I am more confident and more willing to try new things.
 People being kind and accepting of each other
 Nothing, I'm pretty boring.
 Ireland, my grandparents are from there and I would love to see the country.
 Some of the challenges require you to be able to listen/hear/sign and when those challenges come up we have to pick the other challenge since Luke is completely deaf. He cannot hear or use oral language.
 Getting to spend time one-on-one with Luke
 He is a very loud eater.
 Retire a few years earlier than planned.
 We need to be more careful about reading the clues.

 Season 14/3rd place
 My biggest mistake was not being able to figure out what the last surfboard was during the final challenge!
 The hilarious cheese hill task and the underwear marathon.
 Thailand because the country and culture are just so beautiful. I would love to go there again someday.
 To win The Amazing Race! I want to make up for my big blunder in the final leg of the last race.
 I stop more when I am traveling now to enjoy the scenery. I try not to rush things.
 Travel, my family and friends.
 I'm afraid of flying. I always have to suck it up whenever I'm on planes.
 Ireland, because it would be awesome to see where my family came from.
 Being sleep deprived!
 It would be cool if we could visit five continents, avoid being u-turned and be the first team to make it to the final three twice!
 Nothing—she is an awesome teammate and mom!
 Invest.

 I don't think I will change anything since our strategy from last time worked well. Hopefully it will bring us to the final three again and we can win this time! [2]

 I monitor diabetes clinical research trials – new drug clinical trials.
 Season 14 we did really well. We never finished lower than 4th place, but on season 18 we made a lot of mistakes.
 Finishing in 1st place on the 1st leg, and Phil ""signed"" for Luke, ""You are team #1."" So emotional.
 Guilin, China – so beautiful. I would love to go back some day.
 I keep asking myself that same question, I am 56 now – just for the adventure and the friendships you form.
 The first two times we were on the Race I was single. I got married in 2011 and I think that I am happier now than ever before.
 My husband, my grandchildren, my job, my free time and vacations.
 I married a man, at age 54, I have known since I was 6 years old.
 Communication is always a challenge in the race. It is almost impossible to communicate when we cannot see each other, so there are situations where we do not communicate very well.
 We really wanted to visit Ireland; my mother's family is from there and I have always wanted to go.
 Getting to travel with Luke. He was living in Alaska, and then moved to Philadelphia, so I do not get to see him very often.
 I will try to be more patient, I have to realize that Luke is a grown man.

 I help secure funding for and raise awareness of The Pennsylvania School for the Deaf through communications and marketing, outreach to the community, and coordination of administrative processes for the Advancement office. I deliver speeches about my life as a Deaf person to organizations, educational institutes and fundraising events across the United States.
 Not being able to find the last surfboard in the final challenge on our first season, and not being able to find the tea on our second season!!
 Winning the first leg on our first season!
 Switzerland and Thailand were my favorite places to visit on our first season. Australia was my favorite place to visit on our second season.
 To win the million bucks! I had a great time seeing the world with my mom. It was such an incredible experience. I am just so happy that I get to do it with my mom for the third time and to be able to say that we are one of three teams who got to run the Amazing Race three times!
 I stopped drinking tea!
 I am passionate about community involvement, in both the Deaf community and the LGBT community. I believe promoting outreach and raising awareness is vital.
 I lived in Alaska for almost a year. It's one of the best experiences I ever had.
 I just hope that we don't have to do any self-driving - it is pretty tough to communicate with each other when one of us is driving and one of us is sitting in the back. Not easy to communicate with each other!
 Nothing really bugs me - my mom's pretty awesome and easy going.
 I'd love to visit Ireland to see where my family came from.
 Making it farther than we did on our second Race, and enjoying the experience with my mom one more time.

 No alliances. Run this race on our own.[3]

 Arcadia, Calif./ Los Angeles
 Professional Poker Players
 Friends
These two female professional poker players have been best friends for three years, and were also the last women standing in the World Series of Poker Championship Event in 2007 and 2008. From Vegas to Monte Carlo, the two have competed against the toughest fields across the world and hold their own playing for high stakes in a male-dominated sport.
Maria is currently ranked 33rd in the Top 100 Women's All Time Money list among poker players and finished 38th out of 6,358 people in the 2007 World Series of Poker Championship Event.
Tiffany, who is known throughout the poker community as ""Hot Chips,"" fell into poker via Hollywood home games that she played with fellow actors while working in film and television. At the 2008 World Series of Poker Championship Event, Tiffany broke records when she finished 17th out of 6,844 players, the largest field ever conquered by a female in live tournament history.
Maria was born in Taipei, Taiwan, and moved to the United States with her family when she was just four years old and is fluent in Mandarin Chinese. Maria graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a degree in communication and a minor in law. When she is not busy traveling the poker tournament circuit, Maria enjoys singing with her sister's band, ""Another Sky.""
Born with a love for the stage and competition, Tiffany naturally found her way into competitive sports, pageants and the college Speech & Debate team. She got her start in theatre at the age of 10 and began performing and touring with shows across the country. A far departure from poker, Tiffany is a former beauty queen, having held the titles Miss Teen Newhall, Miss Teen Santa Clarita Valley and was a finalist in the Miss Teenage California where she was named Miss Congeniality.
As a team, these two are well traveled, extremely competitive, strong-minded, savvy players who can deal with any hand they are dealt. Even though they are known as two of the hottest young females in poker, they are willing to put pretty aside when it is time to battle it out.[1]
"
Marianna & Julia,"
These feisty sisters describe themselves as best friends and worst enemies, but they're convinced they'll make for an unbeatable Team. Julia serves as the problem solver while Marianna is the athlete. Both are super-competitive and relying on each other may pose some problems.
Marianna claims that the biggest difference between the two sisters is that Julia is emotional while she is as steady as a rock. She describes herself as energetic and sarcastic while Julia describes herself as creative and witty.
Julia is admittedly more sensitive than her sister but is also quick to point out that Marianna doesn't have a sensor button and that at times she can be quite mean. She and her sister have traveled together on numerous occasions and are hoping their experiences will give them an advantage against some of the competition. When asked which Teams they would model their game play after - they both choose past winners BJ and Tyler for their positive energy approach towards the game. As they put it , ""Positive energy creates positive results.""
Both sisters will do whatever it takes to advance their standing in the Race, even if it means flirting their way past the competition.[1]
"
Marisa & Brooke,"
These charming southern belles are best friends and are up for any challenge. They want to prove to the world that they're not just cute blondes and that they can be athletic, cut-throat competitors.
Marisa is currently a broadcast journalism student at the University of South Carolina. She describes herself as ambitious, witty and spontaneous. Her extensive dance training has taught her to be focused and determined, skills that could help her to do well on the race.
Brooke is fascinated with other cultures and can't wait to try out some of the Spanish she learned while living in Spain. She works as a graphic designer and enjoys traveling, painting and being outdoors. She believes that her take-charge attitude will be enough to get them through the rigors of the Race.
She and her best friend are certain this adventure will make them even better friends. And if they have to do a little flirting along the way, they're not opposed to that either – whatever it takes to cross the finish line in first place.[1]
"
Mark & Bill,"
These comic book aficionados are determined to be the most strategic team ever to compete in the Race. Mark and Bill, friends for over 23 years, first met at a science fiction club and have been bonding over their love for comics and games ever since. Mark says that he ""wears geek like a badge of honor.""
Mark describes himself as outgoing, funny and smart. He is willing to go anywhere and isn't afraid of adventure. His last vacation was to Vanuatu in the South Pacific where he climbed a volcano.
Bill is the opposite of Mark—he describes himself as cautious, easygoing, goofy, yet competitive. When asked how the Race could change their friendship, Bill says that the Race might present them with some bad situations, but in the end, they'll finish with a deeper respect for one another.
These masterminds are ready to see what they are made of and are convinced that they can be one step ahead of the competition if they play their cards right.[1]

 Entertainer
 I have 3 brand new ventures I am about to launch. I can't wait for you all to see! I'm still hosting a couple television shows and speaking regularly.
 I can't even see a mistake in our first seasons. In the end we lost in a bad taxi..so I guess getting in that taxi? Yes.
 Sleeping on the ground in India, with my dad, between the cowboys and the globetrotters..a moment I never would have expected to be in, but one of the best for sure. They're still two of our all-time best race friends and real friends to this day.
 I liked Zermatt, Switzerland and India on the next one.
 I know I will win it one way or another. And as I am in the beginning of a lot of really exciting ventures, I would love to have the prize.
 My first two seasons I had just come off of Miss Kentucky and Miss America, they were kind of my identity then. After finishing my reign and then doing two seasons of race back to back at first I didn't know how I could 'top' that. That's when I really changed my mind and started a whole new journey full of real life adventures.
 My Family, My Faith, My Hometown, meeting sweet loyal fans, Food(sorry Mom) but for real, speaking to Children, building new businesses, travel(still), and singing…oh, and dancing.
 That I was Valedictorian, that I've never tried a food I didn't like, that I grew up on a farm with 24 first cousins(I was the oldest).
 If it were my dad I would never fear a thing…ever. He taught me that and he set an example for me that nothing was ever about the money. When you focus on that you lose a lot. My new teammate I will face a lot of challenges. It will be mostly challenges. We don't know each other that well. I don't know how he races or if our styles match, so the challenge will be learning that as we race.
 My dad, that his back is hurt and he can't run this race with me right now. My new partner...I could say a lot, but I guess the main thing is that he's not really the person I expected him to be from watching his first season. But I wish him the best.
 Rome: Pope Francis…Greece: I've still never been.
 I hope to prove that I can do a lot of great things on my own, that I can set a good example again, and that I can help someone else win a million dollars.
 I may have to play all the roles since I don't really know what my partner does. I need to learn how to navigate for sure, and I need to learn to level myself out when I get too excited. My dad used to do that for me, but if he's not with me I have to make these changes in order to stay in the race. Oh and always pack lighter.

 Brothers/Stuntmen
This Team of brothers has been competing – against everyone else and each other – their entire life. Standing at 4' 9"" these married fathers are ready to prove they have what it takes to win one-million dollars.
Mark makes his living as a stuntman and occasionally works as a jockey. This father of two is looking forward to running the Race with his brother in order to continue building on their relationship. Mark believes that the biggest advantage he and his teammate have over their competition is their fitness level and ability to make split second decisions, a skill they have mastered after years of working in physically and mentally demanding fields. Mark enjoys skiing, biking and golfing and describes himself as short, athletic and creative.
Michael is looking forward to working on communication issues he and his brother have had with each other in the past. Michael, also a father of two, splits his time between Maui and Los Angeles. His favorite hobbies include playing music and surfing. He claims that the biggest difference between the two is that he is the surfer and Mark is the skier. Both have worked extensively in films and television including the feature films , Spider-Man, and Seabiscuit.
They chose similar paths in their lives and, after years of surfing big waves and racing horses around a track, they're eager to run the Race of a lifetime with one another for a shot at a million dollars.[1]
"
Marshall & Lance,"


BioBefore the Race
Brothers Marshall & Lance are originally from New York, but have since relocated to Dallas, Texas, where they own and operate a pizza shop. They describe themselves as extremely competitive and stubborn, with each always wanting to get his own way. Marshall explains that he has always tormented his younger brother. When Lance was six or seven years old, Marshall sold him a Sony Walkman for $60; the sale included a hand-written contract stating that Lance was buying the Walkman ""as is,"" with no refund. Shortly after buying the Walkman, Lance determined that it was broken. Lance went crying to their father and told him he wanted his money back, but Marshall pulled out the contract and refused.
Marshall, the older brother, recently got engaged by surprising his fiancée while she was at a spa appointment. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree from Cornell University and says his biggest accomplishment has been starting an Internet security consulting company, growing it to 13 cities and 125 employees, then selling it off in 18 months.
Lance says that one of his pet peeves about himself is when he doesn't give his all to a project he is working on. He says, though, that his greatest accomplishment so far has been opening up the pizza shop with Marshall and seeing the growth. Lance is looking forward to traveling the world to see all the beautiful honeys and any nude beaches.

The brothers decided to sign up for THE AMAZING RACE 5 because they are very different and knew they could make a strong team together. Lance says his personal motivation was to have a ""once-in-a-lifetime experience with my brother and be on TV. Winning cash wouldn't be a bad outcome either."" Marshall hopes to experience the adventurous challenges on the show, adding that he wants to see as much of the world as possible.[1]

 We met when my mother brought Lance home from the hospital when he was born.

 Brothers, friends and business partners.

 Lance and I had never traveled together before.

 Lance and I knew that we would be good partners for THE AMAZING RACE because we are very different. We have different skill sets, and when you put those together, we knew we would make a very strong Team!

 Since we started Café Nostra together almost two years ago, we knew that nothing could test our relationship more than the ups and downs we experienced during the first year of owning a restaurant. We are extremely confident that THE AMAZING RACE can do nothing except strengthen our relationship.

 I bring my levelheaded thinking and intelligence. I will think through the tasks at hand and try to come up with the best possible way to tackle them.


 Lance is very aggressive and likes to rush through things. He will be the person on the Team that drives us forward and keeps us moving.[2]

 I am a flight attendant so I travel all over the United States and beyond, passing out peanuts and sodas and making people smile!!
 Witty, compassionate and fun loving.
 Watching sports, working out (obviously), traveling, snow skiing, yachting, reading and watching THE AMAZING RACE!
 My three children! They are not only beautiful on the outside but on the inside as well. They are the most incredible people I know and I am so blessed to be their mom!
 Getting lost in a country where I am not welcome. I would not do well in jail and don't look good in orange.
 Everything! Experiencing different cultures, eating different food, seeing as much as possible and meeting locals!
 The biggest challenge Hagan and I will experience will probably be patience with each other. I am not the fastest athlete on the planet, and for realizing that she is my partner in this and not just my daughter, trusting each other and not giving up!
 Her ability to not disconnect from her phone/social media and just enjoy the time together.
 I would love to visit Brazil, Holland, Comoros, Equatorial Guinea and New Zealand.
 Well, the million would be a life changer but, honestly, just to experience this once in a lifetime race with my daughter. To have this time with her, to see all that we are going to see, to be a part of such an incredible show and I just know these memories and experiences will last a lifetime and something we will always share. I am also so excited about the other contestants. What an awesome group of people! I am so honored to be a part of it!

 Graduating from Texas A&M University.
 Flying. I'm secretly terrified of flying.
 Seeing different cultures and just how beautiful the world really is. There is so much to see outside of Texas…who knew?!
 Power struggle. Yes, she is my mom, but I have a very hard head and when I think I'm right, no one can change my mind. I like to have control but I realize she is my mom and I need to respect her and her opinions too! Also, being a parent-child team, we don't have advantages that the teams of two younger members have. Plus, we're an all girl team. I am very competitive and I hate losing. But I need to know and remember that she will give her best and I don't want to get frustrated with her, nor do I want to let HER down!
 Honestly, as cheesy as it sounds, it's how nice she is, however, I'm so lucky that she is that way. When I'm in a competitive situation, I want to yell and be crazy while she just wants to be supportive and nice. So if we get behind I know she'll be positive and I will be the one crying, screaming and saying things that I'm sure I'll regret…ha! But we complement each other really well.
 Africa. I doubt we go there because the season before us did. But I would love to see all the wildlife. I'm a huge animal lover. If it was legal, and not extremely dangerous, I would keep wild animals in my house.
 All I hope to accomplish is that at the end of the day, I know I did my very best and put everything I had into every leg. I hope to come out of this appreciating my mom, even more than I already do, because I know how hard she will work and how much she believes in us as a team. We will be in a state of constant stress so I hope at the end of this it will only bring us closer.

Mary & Peach,"
“”Bio[]Sisters Mary and Peach have done quite a bit of traveling together in the past, usually when Mary forces Peach to go so that she can grow as a person. As a Team, they're a study in opposites. Whereas Peach prefers 5 Star hotels and Gucci, Mary likes backpacking and dirt. Mary insists that ""Peach likes to shower, but I don't.""
Peach is a bit concerned about the rigors ahead in THE AMAZING RACE. Before applying, she had never ever put on a backpack; the first time she did, she fell over backwards. In public, this Team tends to attract attention: ""Whenever we are together, people stare at us and ask us what are we doing, because we are causing so much chaos. When we tell them we are sisters, they are in shock!""

 I get things done, but I tend to be impatient.

 Fear of a new environment.
 Seeing new cultures, new environments, scenery, being able to almost start fresh when there is something to look forward to and also start fresh when I come back home.
 How to handle and accept his opinions and not constantly disagree with one another. We often bicker about irrelevant subject matters.
 His poor listening skills and how he will deny something that is a definite fact and laugh about it! That drives me crazy!
 I would love to visit Greece for the beautiful architecture, Brazil for the booties, and Ibiza for the party scene. Italy is another- I have a ton of family there and I have never been to Europe.
 I would love to get back to the core of our relationship before social media (Instagram) and really rekindle that deep love and communication we had when we could literally chat for hours about nothing without looking at our cell phones constantly.
 We get engaged and get back to finding the love we had with one another when it is just him and I and no one else around. We have so many friends and family it's like we don't even go out to dinner and converse anymore.

Megan & Heidi are roommates from Oak Park, California. Megan works as a fashion designer and Heidi is a full-time mother. Both are extremely competitive and not afraid to take risks. These California beauties decided to sign up for the Race just for the challenge and competition.
Heidi grew up in Flint, Michigan, with several stops along the way before she landed in Los Angeles. She is a licensed makeup artist, but works as a full-time mother for her proudest accomplishment, her daughter. Heidi describes herself as athletic, playful and feisty and has specific plans for her prize money if they win the Race.
Megan grew up all around California before settling in Los Angeles. She works as a fashion designer and enjoys drawing, sewing and painting. Megan has never traveled outside the United States and has an extreme phobia of flying. Another motivation for Megan's participation in the Race is to face that fear and put it behind her.
Despite their limited traveling experience, Megan & Heidi are convinced they can rely on each other and on their competitive spirit to outperform the other racers.[1]

Meghan and Cheyne met while playing a competitive game of tetherball in elementary school. After 10 years of friendship, Cheyne realized he could not let the most athletic girl he knew get away. Other than a six-month period where Meghan studied abroad in Italy, this couple has been essentially inseparable for nearly five years.
Meghan and Cheyne both work in fields where they deal extensively with different publics. She is an account executive at a public affairs firm and he works for a social change marketing company where he develops after-school programs and deals with a diverse group of teens, school administrators and corporate executives. When not in the office, Meghan can be found coaching competitive girls' soccer — a sport that she and Cheyne have shared a passion for since they were kids. The couple feels strongly that their occupations and experiences with team sports have taught them effective communication skills and the virtue of patience, which they believe will benefit them in the Race.
Even though they are head-over-heels for each other, they still have their pet peeves just like any other couple. Meghan does not like that he tries to diffuse tense situations with laughter rather than by talking things through. The biggest thing about Meghan that frustrates Cheyne is her stubbornness. He claims that once she has her mind set on something she is difficult to reason with and it can be impossible to change her mind.
Ready to tackle the Race head-on, Meghan and Cheyne are very eager to use the power of positive thinking and their athleticism to compete as a team and hope that this experience further validates their friendship and love.[1]

He's confident that his people skills will give him an advantage over some of the other Racers. He describes himself as energetic, caring and passionate and enjoys scuba diving and racquetball. When asked who he would model his style of game play after, he pointed to Season 7 winners Uchenna and Joyce, while Mike will model his game play after the ""never say die"" attitude of Charla and Mirna.

Mike and Mel are well-traveled, opinionated and huge fans of the Race.[1]

Meredith & Gretchen,"
Meredith & Gretchen are a husband/wife team from Easton, Maryland. Meredith is a retired executive and Gretchen is a retired nurse/flight attendant. Both found love late in their lives, and they are spending every moment making up for lost time. Their inspiration for participating in the Race is strictly for the adventure and the challenge of traveling around the world.
Meredith is a retired executive who spends his time fishing, biking, playing golf and teaching swimming. Father of three sons, Meredith is an avid swimmer who holds seven National Masters Swimming Championship titles. Meredith describes himself as competitive, articulate and compassionate.
Gretchen is a retired flight attendant and registered nurse. Mother of two, Gretchen spends most of her time cooking, biking, gardening and golfing. Gretchen describes herself as outgoing, reliable and kind, and she admits to being quite loud, particularly when she's upset.
Both are big fans of the show, and while watching one evening, they said to each other, ""We could do that. Let's try.""[1][2]
"
Meredith & Maria,"
Meredith & Maria are friends and roommates from Queens, New York. They met on the last day of classes freshman year at Boston University, when Meredith found Maria's ID on the floor of a bar. At first, Maria gave Meredith attitude about having her ID, but the two of them ended up living next door to each other the following year and became great friends.
They say they are both laid back, outgoing, smart and the two funniest girls on earth. However, Meredith says she can be extremely competitive, sensitive and passionate, while Maria can be very passive and non-emotional. Both enjoy hanging out with their friends and share great stories about their escapades around New York.
Their main motivation for doing THE AMAZING RACE is the money, but they say doing the show and traveling with each other will make the experience priceless.[1]

Michael & Kathy,"
“”

BioQ & A
Michael and Kathy met a year and a half ago in Cancun, Mexico. They have kept in touch and maintained a long-distance dating relationship; however, they have never spent more than five days together at a time. Their primary motivation for going on the Race is to see how compatible they are as a couple.
What struck Kathy about Michael were the provocative questions he asked her on their last night in Cancun, when they spent 12 hours together talking and getting to know one another. This was enough to prove to Kathy that Michael is a genuine person worthy of maintaining a long-distance friendship.
Kathy and Michael are polar opposites. Kathy is more high-strung under pressure and Michael is very laid back. Michael describes himself as unconventional, amusing and dark, while Kathy describes herself as moody, caring and oversensitive. They both agree that their different personalities complement each other well.
Michael has done quite a bit of traveling throughout Mexico, England, France, Holland, Spain and Canada, while Kathy has been to Mexico, Philippines and Canada. The most important item in his backpack is his CD player, because he feels that music will change any mood into a good one. Her most valuable item is her journal.

Michael resides in San Diego and lives with his cat, Tig. His birth date is May 30. Kathy lives in Birmingham, Michigan. Her birth date is December 4.[1]


Michael: I'm well traveled, with experience dealing with numerous cultures.
Kathy: Most of my travels have been within the United States. Outside of that, the only countries I have visited are Mexico, Canada and Philippines.


 The time between stepping off a plane or train and finding some place to spend the night.
 Adjusting to different climates and time zones other than my ""normal"" seems to put me in a funk for a day or so.


 My CD player and CDs. Music gives me power and can turn any mood I'm in into a good one.
 My empty journal seems value-less right now, but once I am able to write about my travels, it will be the one item in my backpack that will be of worth to me. That, and my hairclip!


 I'm a sucker for a free vacation.
 The Race has a lot of great elements that I find appealing: competing, traveling, and working as a Team with my teammate Michael.


 We've been to different locations in the states and have always had a good time.
 We actually met while we were both on our travels. Michael and I live on different. coasts, so the only way to see each other was to travel. We've been to Cancun and various states. It's always like a great mini-vacation.


 Losing to a couple of squares.
 Initially, it was to be the first Team eliminated on the Race. Deep down I truly don't feel that we will be; however, to get past the first leg of the Race will take off a lot of anxiety for me.


 I bring travel experience, levity and unabashed confidence to the Team. I have no weaknesses.
 I am a people person for the most part, which will help in communicating with different people. However, when under pressure I can tend to be a bit high-strung and become moody.


 She brings salesmanship and a cute face to the Team. Men go out of their way to help her, and we'll use that obtaining directions and other help when needed. Like myself, she has no weaknesses.
 Michael is very patient and always stays calm in any given situation, which will help me calm down. A very good sedative. Having said that, sometimes I wish I could jolt him up a bit to get him more energized.


 My cat Tig (aka Li'l Baller).
 The actual comfort of home, from home-cooked meals to taking a shower. Just being.


 English, decent Spanish.
 Other than English, none fluently.


 Egypt: the pyramids
 Bali: I want to confirm all the hype. And any part of Europe, since I've never been.


 Mexico, seeing that I spent half a year traveling it.
 I can't say I'm prepared best for any given country. If I had to pick a region, then I'd say Asia/South Asia. Being Asian may be an asset in those countries, so that could be advantage to me. Additionally, my travel experience in Philippines, although many years ago, has not been forgotten.[2]

 Passionate, extreme and unique.

 Harley Morenstein of Epic MEAL Empire. Obnoxious at times, similar look and style.
 Kesha- unique, own style/image, like to have fun.
 If I'm traveling somewhere new to me, the possibility of getting lost or stranded with no resources.
 Getting to see different cultures and ways of life, change of scenery from city to city, and country to country.
 Rochelle's listening ability. She says I give good advice, and can coach her through situations, but she doesn't always listen to my advice.
 That she gets legitimately pissed off if I beat her at anything. Even something as small as a game of checkers. I love her competitiveness, but not when I'm her competition.
 Tokyo, Japan. Many wrestlers I know travel there for events, and I've heard nothing but amazing things from them all.
 I hope to gain a stronger connection with Rochelle, to see if we can handle the stress, and work together through it. I also feel it would be a very good bonding experience.
 It would without a doubt test us for the future. A worldwide race within a month would test our strength, teamwork and communication skills. If we come out of the race stronger, we should be able to handle anything.

Millie & Chuck,"


BioQ & A
Millie, 29, works as an Environmental Teacher at the Tennessee Aquarium and describes herself as a motivated, fun, daredevil/adventurer with no fears, except for mayonnaise: she hates the stuff. She holds a BA in Communication Arts from Bryan College in Dayton, Tennessee, and has lived in Taiwan, teaching English, and traveled to Israel and Russia. Speaks French, conversational Chinese and some Russian. Millie was once on the Tonight Show after Leno bumped into her and her roommate and asked them to ""say stupid Baywatch lines in our shower--in bikinis--which we did,"" so she has a wild side somewhere deep down. She enjoys volleyball, water skiing, rollerblading, snorkeling and swimming, and blows off steam by running, talking (or fighting) with Chuck, praying, and reading the Bible. Millie believes her man Chuck is ""hotter than Brad Pitt."" On the downside, her man can also be too ""anal and meticulous."" Millie admits that she's bad with money, too often speaks before she thinks, and that they're both afraid to commit.

Chuck, 28, a self-employed Tennessean, has most recently worked as a valet, hauler, construction worker and personal trainer. A physically active guy, Chuck holds a BS in Exercise Science from the University of Tennessee, Chattanooga, and enjoys playing tennis and skiing. Chuck likes traveling, but has only been to Mexico and Canada. He speaks no foreign languages. Self-described as being ""random, deliberate and kind."" His only fears while traveling are ""criminals if I had to sleep outside."" Considers himself slower than his teammate, Millie, whom he says is ""more fearless"" and ""less thoughtful"" than himself. Chuck tries to remain calm under pressure or if upset, but admits to having a ""unique pouting manner.""[1]


 I've done a good bit of international travel to Russia, Israel, Taiwan and China. I've always lived to travel and explore.
 I've taken several road trips, visiting 47 states. Though I've done some international traveling, most has been in the US.


 Being out of your comfort zone. Traveling reduces you to the basis of who you are and reveals much about yourself you never knew. That's also one of the best parts.
 Time restraints when trying to see as much as you can. Also tight quarters can be awfully challenging when not traveling alone. Then again, this inevitable togetherness is one of the greatest qualities of traveling with others.


 Pages I ripped out of the Bible verse prayer book. Since I am a Christian I try to read and meditate on verses everyday; it helps me focus on what's important and prioritize. I'll definitely need that on the Race, plus doing this makes me a more tolerable person to be around.
 The lightest item. A light pack is key to faster time.


Millie: A trip around the world while attempting incredible challenges, a chance to see what our Team and relationship is made of.
 To compete, travel around the world with my best friend and the $.


 Mainly for vacations, which we have always enjoyed, but nothing as stressful and arduous as this. We both have an adventurous streak, so we've always enjoyed going off the beaten path.
 We've taken several road trips together and have always thoroughly enjoyed each other. Of course, we have had our share of quarrels while traveling.


 Losing. Not just the $, but also losing the chance to make it all the way around the world. Compromising who we are and what we believe to win. Being rude or unkind when I'm under stress.
 Being eliminated and not being able to travel the world.


 Experience from the past will hopefully help us. Also, I think I'm a quick thinker and a fast mover; I tend to look for creative solutions and can be resourceful. I'm not a quitter and am intensely competitive. I can also be too hasty and make errors in judgment.
 My strengths are probably my competitive nature, road trip experience, athleticism and fearlessness regarding adrenalin rush activities. My weaknesses are being too deliberate and analytical, resulting in lost time, and sometimes being too laid-back.


 Chuck is very talented physically; he is able to complete any physical challenge with ease. Also, he has traveled a lot on the road, which will hopefully help us in navigation. He is not a quitter and is the most competitive person I know. Chuck can take too much time to make decisions.
 Strengths: relatively fearless, very communicative and smart with people; international travel experience, fast thinker and never-quit attitude. Weaknesses: So fast sometimes she really doesn't think and is occasionally over-trusting.


 My family: parents, brothers, sister and seven adorable nieces and nephews.
 Definitely my mom, dad, sister, all of my family and friends. I'm so blessed!


 A little French, a little Mandarin Chinese, a little Russian. It's been a while since I've spoken any of these.
 English and pointing (this way or that way?).


 Africa for the wildlife and diverse terrain.
 As many countries as possible, and the last Pit Stop!


 Other than the US, Taiwan. Since I lived there a short while, I feel I would be able to get around more easily than anyone else.
 Other than my own, any that has a lot of English-speaking people.[2]

 Our biggest challenge will be not bickering with each other over insignificant things like we often do at home. If we can maintain good teamwork we will be very tough to beat.
 When Misti is stressed out she often snaps at me even when I am not the cause of her stress.
 There are so many on my list. Italy – beauty and history, Australia – Great Barrier Reef, South Africa – safari in Kruger National Park (or any African safari) and Egypt – pyramids.
 I think it will be an amazing experience that we can share with our children when they are grown which will teach them to follow their dreams.

 I've traveled a lot over the last eight years. I've been out of the country several times, so I'm used to other cultures and respecting lifestyles different than my own.
 I've traveled a lot for relaxation and pleasure in the Islands. I traveled to Europe twice, visiting France, Spain and Amsterdam.


 Packing!
 Packing! And did I mention packing? Packing!


 Pictures of my family that cheer me up when I get a little homesick and my ""Oh Baby"" lip gloss that keeps me feeling ""looking good""!
 My MAC gloss. The last thing I want is lips that look like they've been eating powdered donuts.


 Being married to a professional athlete is wonderful, but it's hard being in the supporter role all the time. I want to experience what my husband has experienced the last 11 years and have the roles reversed for a while!
 To prove that two black mothers and wives can compete in a physical arena that no one expects us to do well in.


 Almost all of my vacations have been with my partner and her family. We all have a blast and that's why we continue to travel together!
 Yes. We vacation together all the time. We have a blast!


 Being eliminated early.
 Being eliminated in the first round. But that won't happen.


 I bring a very competitive, aggressive attitude to the Team. Patience can sometimes by my weakness.
 I think I bring patience and physical strength to our Team. I think my weakness is making too quick decisions at times.


 My teammate has a great way of calming me down and making me laugh.
 My partner rationalizes more about decisions, which is a great strength.


 Seeing my husband, children, family and friends! I'll also miss being able to play tennis!

 Resilience. Period.
 Resilience is really the reason why you get up and try an activity for the 60th time after you've been doing it for four or five hours. We focus on using resilience every day in our work. But the race is all about not giving up, even if you think you're the last team.

 Morgan is a very quick problem solver, incredibly fast. There are so many things. I might be looking at a math problem, or I might be looking at a cooking recipe and something doesn't make sense to me. Morgan just comes in and just rearranges it a little bit, and you will have your answer right there.
 Lena is a people reader. She is very, very good at reading people for who they are. And I think that skill set will come very much in handy on the race.

 Being kidnapped. I'd hate for my family and friends to wonder where I am or what happened to me. Or getting thrown in a foreign prison.
 Where do I start? I love meeting new people and trying new food. Experiencing a different culture and sharing stories. It all gets me excited.
 We both always think we're right. We could definitely work on compromising every now and then. We also bicker quite a bit.
 She is so stubborn. Once she's made a decision, it is an act of God to get her to change her mind.
 That's a tough one. I'd like to go to the Greek Isles with my boyfriend because it looks beautiful and for the great food. I want to go to Ibiza with my girlfriends.
 Pushing ourselves to the limit and learning from each other. I'd love to see how we react in a foreign country under pressure. We travel a lot together, but it has never been stressful.

 Hawaii is my dream destination to visit. I have been in love with the ocean since I was little. Surf, sun and sand is all I need!

Nathan & Jennifer,"
This athletic couple first met in college while living together with other friends. Both admit they couldn't stand each other at first, but soon grew closer and started dating. They've broken up several times in their two-year courtship, but remain true to each other. In one breath each will tell you that the other is their soul-mate and in the next, they'll tell you how much the other drives them crazy.
The biggest difference between the two is organization–he's organized and she is not. Both have dominant personalities and tend to be very stubborn.
Nathan teaches volleyball and also works as a waiter. Jennifer is currently enrolled at Cal State Long Beach and works as a gymnastics coach. She was also on the Los Angeles Clippers Spirit dance team. Jennifer describes herself as thrilling and loving while he describes himself simply as ""one cool dude."" Both are eager to put their relationship to the test on a race around the world.[2]
"
Nick & Starr,"
This brother/sister team will stop at nothing to win the Race. Both are extremely driven and competitive, especially with one another. They admit to being over-zealous when a prize is involved – even if it's only bragging rights. They're excited to use this to their advantage on the Race. 
Nick and Starr could practically be twins, and consider each other best friends, even though they rarely see each other due to distance. They hope to strengthen their relationship on this adventure, but do worry that since they haven't spent much time together in several years that they could get on one another's nerves. After all, in high-school they were bitter enemies. 
Nick claims that the biggest difference between them is that Starr can be a bit reckless – she leaps into a situation without thinking about the repercussions - while Nick thinks everything through before acting. Starr claims that she is simply more spontaneous and figures everything will work out in the end. 
Nick and Starr have both accomplished their life-long dreams. Nick performs on the New York stage in an Off-Broadway musical called The Fantasticks, while Starr was a cheerleader for the Dallas Cowboys for the past three seasons. 
They're anxious to bring a new approach to the game and are motivated to strengthen their relationship. They believe that their charisma, wit and relentless spirit will make for a dangerous combination.[1]

This grandson/grandfather duo believes that Nicolas's traveling expertise will give them a leg up against the other Teams.
Donald has been married for 42 years and has two children. The sparks will undoubtedly fly along the course of the Race as Donald is never shy about telling his grandson what to do. While Nicolas relies on his ability to read maps and quickly navigate computers, Donald relies on old school street smarts and claims to be a jack of all trades.
Regardless of who's calling the shots in the heat of the Race, these two are looking forward to traveling the world together and creating lasting memories.[1]

Oswald and Danny have traveled extensively together, mostly to Los Angeles and New York, but also to Paris, Milan, and Berlin. On their travels, they ""had amazing new experiences and most of all, lots of fun.""
The pair decided to team up for THE AMAZING RACE because they expect the experience to bring them closer together. ""Only someone like Oswald could be strong enough to endure the kind of life-changing experiences that a project like this may bring,"" said Danny. Oswald added, ""We balance each other perfectly.""

Q & A[]


  I'm an experienced traveler. I'm resourceful and find it easy to adapt to new languages and cultures. I don't do as well at anything physical, I'm afraid of heights and have only had my driver's license for a month.
  My strengths consist of being somewhat street smart and having a pretty strong athletic background. My weaknesses are my language skills; I only speak Spanish and English.


  Danny is street-savvy and more adventurous when it comes to sports. Also, he can drive. He's not as experienced as I am at traveling, languages, or other cultures.
  Oswald has great language skills, speaking and understanding about five different languages. His only weakness is fear of heights.

Pat and Brenda met at work about eighteen years ago, when Pat introduced Brenda to her future husband. When they both became mothers in 1987, they took backpacking trips together as a break from home and work responsibilities. Their combined strengths make them a strong Team: whereas Pat is a creative thinker and is not afraid to ask for what she wants, Brenda is laid back and likes to be organized.

Peggy & Claire,"
“”Bio[]Peggy and Claire met about four years ago, while walking their dogs at a lake in the sierras. Their dogs quickly struck up a friendship, and so did Peggy and Claire. Last year the two spent ten days together in Santa Monica, California, and enjoyed the experience very much. The greatest difficulty was the fact that Peggy is an early riser, while Claire prefers to sleep in. When Peggy saw the AMAZING RACE application on the CBS website she called Claire, and both agreed that it would be fun to compete.
When considering how their experience in THE AMAZING RACE might change their relationship, Peggy observes, ""Between the two of us, we're a hundred and twenty-something years old. It would take something more earth shattering than a TV show to change our relationship. There are some advantages to growing old! You don't sweat the small stuff.""
Q & A[]
 I have a good memory for names, places, times, and dates, am excellent at math, and enjoy everything.
 I can yodel. I am energetic, competitive, personable, and I've traveled extensively. I am strong for a woman of indeterminate years! A major weakness is that I rush into things without carefully thinking them out.
 Claire is very intelligent, well traveled and very well read. She can also yodel. She laughs at my stupid observations and never complains when she feels bad or loses a toenail. Her only weakness on this trip is that she moves too fast that she doesn't see things around her. I think it's just that she is so focused on getting to the end. That determination is also one of her strengths that I admire.
 Peggy is creative, energetic, personable, and very good company. She can charm the birds out of the trees.

Jennifer and Preston have been dating for nearly two years. In some ways, they have similar personalities but, for the most part, they couldn't be more different. Preston is a laid back guy that is used to sticking to a routine, while Jennifer hates planning and enjoys spontaneity. One of the qualities they share is that they are both very strong minded individuals and, as a team, they hope to bring out the best in each other and solidify their relationship.
On several occasions they have broken up and made up. Jennifer is ready to plan for her future by either moving forward in her relationship with Preston or ending it and moving forward in her life without him, while Preston has taken the step of moving from Birmingham, Ala. to Columbia, S.C. to be closer to her but still has some reservations about what the future may bring.
Jennifer is currently studying nursing during the day and bartending at night. This self-described driven, outspoken and independent woman enjoys traveling, hanging out with friends and shopping. Preston is a software engineer who enjoys working out, hanging out with friends and watching Auburn football. Both are very active and competitive and they feel these qualities will help them work well as a team.[1]

 I manage healthcare software implementations in hospitals and clinics. You probably grew up with paper charts and I am helping replace them, and other electronic medical records, with our software.
 I work with and manage many different people and personalities, and I have a ""do what it takes"" approach to work and life.
 Optimistic, driven and outgoing.
 Dancing, traveling and intramural sports—volleyball, softball, kickball.
 Ryan Seacrest—I know he's a guy, but we both get along with everyone and we are very driven, hard-working people.
 JFK Jr. because he is smart, sexy, witty, likeable and politically savvy.
 I'm proud of myself for always being up for trying anything. Life is short and I want to experience as much as I possibly can.
 Nothing scares me when I travel. I dread hotels without elevators when I'm packing heavy, though.
 I love to travel! I love experiencing different cultures…people, history, food, animals and shops.
 Neither of us likes to be wrong and we are very competitive with each other. I would like to work on being a team and taking each other's advice.
 He's insanely anal…obsessive-compulsive anal. Things always have to be neat, clean and exactly how he wants them.
 Bora Bora, Tahiti—I've seen pictures and it looks amazing. I would love to stay in one of those huts in the ocean.
 I hope to reconnect with Dave. Being away from my husband for a year, with a lack of regular communication and having nothing in common due to our environments was way more difficult than I ever thought it would be.

 The obvious response would be the ability to cope and manage excessive stressors, and physical fitness due to the nature of the challenges. But persistence and attention to detail seem to be the attributes most essential for success.
 Motivated, resourceful and aggressive.
 Socializing, boating, fitness and traveling.
 Bill Clinton – we share a common affinity for music, politics, academics and socializing.

 Having graduated from undergraduate studies in three years while being a young father (unexpectedly), a full-time employee and serving in the National Guard.
 Being disoriented in an unfamiliar environment without knowing the language.
 Experiencing foreign cultures and ""once-in-a-lifetime"" experiences.
 Rachel is a persistent optimist which, for a realist can be annoying and overwhelming.
 Russia, due to the historical significance of the Cold War and prevalence of vodka!
 Travel, communication and competition. Traveling to exotic locations while honing our communication skills and improving upon our relationship.

 Missing my daughter.
 This is my third  and my first two I did with Brendon, my husband. It was really fun to race with him but this Race is really exciting because I get to do this with my sister. Growing up, Elissa and I moved a lot. I think I went to three middle schools and two high schools. Moving and only having your sister as a constant made us super close, then we went to college, got married, and didn't live together anymore. We still love to do everything together. Elissa was on Big Brother after I was, we got engaged the same weekend, we got married the same year, and we had babies together! So for us, doing the Race together is a dream come true! SISTER BONDING!
 Africa Safari again. It’s amazing, I mean who gets to do that? But excited for everywhere.
 Bonding time and building memories. Time with my sister is so valuable since we are both so busy with life. This is an opportunity to make some memories as sisters! We didn't get to do BB together so this will be really fun and exciting! We get to make memories, go on a crazy adventure and try to make better lives for our families.
 I think the biggest threats are the Racers. The  teams know what to expect and even though I have raced twice, my partner has never raced so this will be totally new to her. It's probably good to have a new set of eyes on something I feel so confident about, but I also hope that she listens to me because after all, I've done this twice before and NEVER BEEN ELIMINATED. This also adds pressure on both of us, but I mean I'm Rachel Reilly, I've won two reality shows. I’ve got this in the bag ;)
 
I think being on  prepared me more for this than Big Brother. The Amazing Race isn't usually as strategic with the other Racers, but I think since we have Racers, Houseguests, and Castaways we are going to really see more of a social game being played. I am totally prepared to make alliances on this race and use my race experience and my BB experience.

Ray & Deana are a dating team from Canfield, Ohio and Youngstown, Ohio respectively. Ray is a stockbroker and Deana is a marketing and promotions executive. Their primary motivation for participating in this Race is to put their on-again/off-again relationship to the test and see how they fare.
Ray, who is 17 years older than Deana, has worked as a stockbroker for 18 years. A former college and semi-professional football player, Ray describes himself as cocky and admits that he's never wrong about anything. He enjoys weightlifting, singing and karate.
Deana is admittedly just as determined and competitive as her teammate. She grew up camping in the backwoods of Ohio and has never traveled outside the United States. Deana's favorite hobbies include lifting weights, karate, hunting and fishing.
Both admit they are looking for some answers to what the future holds for their relationship and are hoping the Race will provide some.[1]

Nevertheless, Yolanda & Ray enjoy working out together and are looking forward to the adventure of the Race and the thrill of competition.[1]

Twenty-eight-year-old Reichen is a pilot and teaches at a flight school in Los Angeles. A former US Air Force officer and a graduate of the US Air Force academy, he is married to his teammate Chip. He loves skiing and flying and is very into being physically fit. He describes himself as ""detail-oriented, caring and thrill-seeking."" He speaks French and has traveled internationally quite a bit. Reichen's views on relationship are much more liberal than Chip's -- He enjoys flirting with other guys, but that makes Chip upset. Reichen likens himself to Ben Affleck--""intense""—and says Chip is like Bruce Willis: ""steady and true."" Reichen says he never procrastinates; he gets things done NOW.

Chip is 36 years old and is an active consultant raising financing and setting up projects in film, music, and multi-media around the world. He attended Yale and Harvard Business School. He loves hiking in the mountains and participating in triathlons."" He describes himself as ""determined, free thinking and mindful."" He says he is like Winston Churchill: ""steady...never say no; anything is possible."" Chip lived in Hong Kong for three years, in Paris for six months and in London for two years. He is in great physical shape.[1]


 Most of my experiences have been on the adventurous side. I've been all through Western Europe, Australia, Mexico and Canada, for some skiing.
 I have traveled extensively and lived in Asia for two years. I trekked in Nepal and South America, but most of my recent travel has been to boardrooms and not the ""outback."" This will be fun.


 I hate packing for the trip. You might not pack enough, or worse, you might pack too much. It's not just stressful, it's boring, unless you're packing for THE AMAZING RACE.
 Directions, getting the right ones.


 Energy bars and water. I get pretty irritated when I'm hungry.
 Pen and paper, because this Race is not only about getting to a destination fleet of foot, but making sure you know the way and local languages.


 For the great experience, but mostly to fulfill the need to be honest about my life—to anyone.
 To present a new type of gay relationship to the viewing audience and win.


 Chip and I have taken some killer trips overseas and in the great USA, too. Mostly ski trips. We once spent two weeks fishing and diving in the Great Barrier Reef. That was incredible.
 We love to travel and explore new things all over the world. We usually travel well together because Reichen is so organized and I love to go!


 Hunger.
 I don't have a fear, but getting lost will really frustrate me.

 Professional beach volleyball player
 I am both a professional beach volleyball player, co-own a small production company and run a YouTube channel, all of which I do with my brother and partner on , Maddison McKibbin. Together we compete as a team of two on the AVP Professional Beach Volleyball Tour (USA's domestic circuit) and create video content based around our sport, travel, and our many adventures for our YouTube channel, The McKibbin Brothers.
 Coffee, wine, and happy.
 Photography, videography, reading, writing, and drinking coffee.
 It's funny, after playing volleyball for nearly two decades at some of the highest levels, the thing I'm proudest of accomplishing in my life has little to do with sports. Nearly 10 years ago I lived and played professional volleyball in Italy, and while I was there I was able to learn and eventually become fluent in the Italian language.Looking back, I am truly proud that I got up every morning, walked down to the town's only coffee bar to sit and chat with the Italian villagers, practicing speaking the language until I became fluent. To this day, nine years later, I still keep in touch with many of the same people from that very same town, San Giustino, located in the middle of Italy.
 For some reason I am always nervous about not making my connecting flight.
 I know it's cliché, but I truly get most excited about diving into a new culture; tasting exotic and strange foods and drinks unique to the area, listening to a new language, casually exploring a place I've never been before at my own pace.
 I'm torn between Iceland and Ireland. Fortunately, my career has taken me to many different places around the world, but I'd really like to play a round of golf in Ireland and snap a few photos in Iceland.
 Growing up watching the show I would often catch myself thinking, ""If that were me, what would I do…"" or ""I could definitely win this roadblock or that detour…"" or ""welp, it'd be over for me if I had to do that!"" etc. When you watch  at home, you can't help but wonder how you would actually fare in such a high stakes competition.
And by some stroke of luck I get this amazing opportunity to legitimately test only my abilities, but that of my partner's as well, who just so happens to be both my brother and the kid who sat there with me watching  on TV, bouncing our own strategies off one another over the years. I am excited to see if my brother and I can put some of our many differences aside and come together to hopefully make the formidable team we once imagined we could be if we ever found ourselves on The Amazing Race... without killing one another.

We shoot, edit, produce, and distribute all of our content and work as contractors for companies to produce branded content.
 Altruistic, optimistic, and inquisitive.
 Reading, making videos, learning about the business of sports, body surfing, and watching documentaries and TV shows.
 Getting my masters of communication management in digital media at The USC Annenberg School of Communication and not giving up on volleyball and winning the 2017 AVP San Francisco Open.
 Getting sick the day I land in a new country, preventing me from fully enjoying the place I'm in.
 Looking out the plane during the final descent to a country I've never been before. That specific moment brings back this anticipatory excitement of getting to see things I've never seen before, meet new people, and not knowing what this next adventure has in store.
 I've always dreamed of flying into Queenstown with my girlfriend, renting a sprinter van, obviously spending time driving around the mountains and lakes there, driving the east coast of the South Island, taking the ferry to Wellington and then slowly making my way up to Auckland.
In 2017, we rented a sprinter van and drove a southwest loop in the US from California, through Nevada, Southern Utah, and Northern Arizona and it still remains the most memorable trip I've ever taken because it made me feel like we were explorers, like we were Lewis and Clark. I would love to recreate that trip, that feeling, that experience in a place as naturally beautiful as New Zealand.
 I want to see as much of the world as I possibly can while testing the boundaries of what my brother and I can accomplish in a competition filled with challenges completely foreign to what we're used to going up against together.

Rob & Amber,"


The Amazing Race 7 The Amazing Race: All-Stars 
Rob & Amber are an engaged couple from Canton, Massachusetts and Beaver, Pennsylvania, respectively. They had an alliance together and fell in love when they competed with each other on ""."" Amber won the one million dollar prize, and Rob finished as the runner-up. During the live finale of the show in May 2004, before the outcome was even announced, Rob proposed to Amber, while she wore a t-shirt with the inscription, ""I Love Rob!""
Prior to ""Survivor: All Stars,"" Rob competed on "","" the fourth installment of the series, where he was the seventh voted off. Amber previously competed on ""Survivor The Australian Outback,"" the second installment of the series, where she was eleventh voted off, but was a part of the jury to decide the winner. Before their lives on SURVIVOR, Rob worked as a construction foreman and Amber as an administrative assistant.

Both of them are excited to participate in the Race, as they have been fans of the show for some time. They hope their competitive natures, which helped them compete on SURVIVOR, will propel them through to win THE AMAZING RACE.[3]
America's Sweethearts met, fell in love and got married...all in front of the cameras. It all started during , where Rob finished in second place to Amber.
Shortly after, they were cast on the seventh season of the Race and fought their way to the top of the pack, ultimately finishing as the runner-ups to Joyce and Uchenna.
Considered by many to be one of the best reality television competitors, ""Boston"" Rob changed the way the Race was played forever, adding a level of manipulation never seen on the game. Despite the difference in their personalities; Rob is outspoken and boisterous while Amber is more quiet and reserved; they somehow balance each other out and are very strong competitors.
Since their time on the Race, Rob has gone on to host his own segment for CBS's , ""Rob to the Rescue,"" and he and Amber have built a home and settled in Pensacola, Fla. Rob describes himself as competitive and intense while Amber describes herself as caring and pragmatic.

It will be interesting to see how the other teams will react to this competitive duo. To what lengths will Rob go to avoid finishing as the runner-up yet again? Truth be told, it's less about the money for this team and all about the bragging rights.[4]

 I think communication with your teammate is going to be so crucial. We've seen time and time again. Youth and youthfulness will help. But with past winners like Kim and Penn, they're successful in their communication, and their ability to really be on the same page at all times. And that's something I think my dad and I are trying to really adapt and put into our guidebook. And something I think we have a leg up on and that we have a 25-year relationship. We have multiple languages that we can communicate in. We can communicate further apart than some of the other contestants might be able to. And we could even do so underwater if we had to.
 Not only that, but he talks really well. I can sign no problem with other people in other countries. If I need I can communicate with other people in different languages, well, I can communicate using gestures and such. We're going to be fine. We're going to be perfectly fine. We're going to have really good communication. We are prepared.

 There's too many; I can't pick one. I like the Globetrotters. They're funny. They like to banter with each other. And I feel like we're very similar to that.
 I think one thing that we've talked about is trying to pick out a lot of traits that we found to be really successful in teams that have come back. Soe, like you said, the Globetrotters. I'd even say the Cowboys are really similar in that the whole time they kept such a positive mindset and always wanted to have fun, joke around with each other. And that's rule number one. If you're looking at our notebook in my backpack right now, we wrote down, ""Rule number one is F. U. N."" We're here to have some fun. At the end of the day, there'll be stressful moments. But we need to tell each other, ""We're here to have some fun."" That's the goal at the end of the day.

 I think my dad is a lot more of a patient builder. And he's a lot better at working on puzzles that take a longer period of time. I think I might get a little impatient sometimes. And that's something that he'll be able to really sit down with and figure out.
 I feel like he's really good with words. Playing around with words, he's really good at puns and such. That's really his strength. It's not my strength. [Laughs.]
 These interviews are going really long. Are you sure you haven't had your ""Phil""? [Laughs.]

 When Rob thinks he is right about something…that's it, he's RIGHT! No one can tell him different.
 Italy and Greece. Both have interesting cultures, history and gorgeous water.
 Our goal is to spend a loving, fun, active and adventurous life together so I think ""The Amazing Race"" is a perfect way to launch it.

 Heart.
 Composure. Both of those things. And not giving up. Being able to stop, assess, and make the right choice.

 I haven't thought about that one in a while. I've thought about it for sure. Kind of the ""biker moms"" from…I forgot what season it is. They lost because they didn't go to the Fast Forward. But they were the biker chicks. She's a big Peloton coach now. They just had kind of a ""do their own thing,"" whatever. Super duper strong. And they only lost because of a little mistake. But I relate to their energy.

Ron & Christina,"


The Amazing Race 12 The Amazing Race: Unfinished Business
Ronald & Christina are a father/daughter Team who are competing in the Race to make up for lost time. Since Ronald was constantly traveling for work throughout much of his daughter's formative years, Christina hopes the Race will allow her father—a self-proclaimed workaholic—to stop and smell the roses and provide them with some meaningful time together.
Ronald, a first-generation immigrant and eldest of five, works as a Vice President of sales for a paper packaging company. His proudest achievements are his thirty-one years of marriage and raising two independent daughters. Christina is Ronald's youngest daughter and holds degrees from both Duke and Princeton. She once served in the State Department and often wishes her Teammate could be as diplomatic as she.

Neither are strangers to the unpredictability of international travel as they have both lived and worked abroad. Ronald describes himself as inquisitive and open-minded, while Christina describes herself as loyal and adventurous. This father/daughter duo is excited to grow closer, make friends across continents and create Race history by being the first father/daughter Team to claim the $1 million prize.

Ron is a former Iraq War POW who is currently a student at the University of Georgia and works as a motivational speaker. Kelly was crowned Miss South Carolina in 2002 and works as a Legislative Correspondent. Their primary motivation for participating in the Race is strictly for the adventure.
Ron grew up in Lithia Springs, Georgia. A fan of the movie ""Top Gun,"" Ron became a pilot after joining the Army and started flying Apache helicopters. When Ron's helicopter was shot down in Iraq, he was captured, interrogated, held captive and later rescued by the United States Marines. Following his rescue, Ron returned home and was introduced to the reigning Miss South Carolina. The two have been an item ever since. Ron is very competitive and admits he's a thrill seeker. He currently works as a motivational speaker.
Kelly's determination has always been a part of her life. After growing up with a learning disability, she graduated cum laude from North Greenville College. After being crowned Miss South Carolina, she went on to compete in the Miss America pageant. Kelly describes herself as well-rounded and persistent.

Russell & Cindy,"


BioQ & A
Russell is a 32-year-old model/actor/entrepreneur who describes himself as hilarious and a leader. He loves the adventure of traveling and greatly dislikes losing or failing at anything. He admits he talks a lot, but that he has an ability to get everyone involved. People say he looks like Mel Gibson, but he says he's like the TV character McGyver because he gets things done. He calls Cindy ""a female film character James Bond."" He is always on the go and cannot stand not to be doing anythingl He claims to be very intuitive, which can be a great gift or a pain in the butt. About his going on the Race with Cindy, Russell declares, ""Some people may know their partners better, but that may be what makes us so great to watch: the unknown or X factor.""

Cindy is 39 years old and describes herself as a former supermodel and currently, an inventor. She loves to jet ski, play pool and write stories. She describes herself as ""loyal, playful and spontaneously adventurous to the point of insanity."" She insists on winning; quitting is not an option. Because of her Irish background and being passionate about life, Cindy must blow off steam, and she does so by telling the person off right to their face. She and Russell debate things constantly. She admits that both of them can get a little jealous, and adds, ""Russell more than me."" Cindy has lived in other countries, such as Japan, Germany, Paris, Ireland and Indonesia. She says she has always had a fantasy of being in a ""Jewel of the Nile"" situation with a man and hopes THE AMAZING RACE would be that. She says she has a great deal of respect for Russell and that he has never disappointed her. But, she says, both have been so busy that they have had difficulty spending long periods of time together.[1]


 Quite vast. Have lived in Taiwan, Japan, Germany, Italy for 4–5 months at a time. Have also traveled to at least 5 other countries for work.
 Spontaneous! In the past I was a model with Ilene Ford, then moved over to Wilhelmina Agency. That business was always a world of opportunity to travel to the major markets on a whim. In between when I'd vacation, I'd pick the most adventurous, remote locations, like Indonesia.


 The other people you come in contact with.
 Personally, I enjoy the unknown, so sometimes I'd get lost on purpose in a country, just for the adventure of testing something new!


 My socks. If your feet don't get taken care of, then they won't take care of you.
 The alarm clock.


 For the adventure. I have seen a lot of places, but there is a lot more out there to see.
 This particular adventure would make a great home video!


 No, but it should be interesting.
 No, but Russell is the only man I'd want to do this type of trip with.


 There is not any fear, just a lot of anticipation.
 Bungee cord jumping sounds like a death wish to me.


 My ability to problem-solve and be a good leader. I also laugh all the time, which makes tough situations easier.
 When or if there is any type of emergency, I'm usually the one people rely on. I am strong and clear. I guess to some it's a weakness being free with a show of emotions, but to me, well, I consider that an expression of strength.


 She is strong-willed and a great competitor. As far as weaknesses, we will have to wait and see.
 Russell tends to compete and analyze a situation rather quickly and intelligently, and then he handles it. I find it quite comforting.


 My friends.
 On a shallow note: my café lattes, charming restaurants and candlelight.


 English and some Spanish.
 Enough Indonesian to get by, a small handful of Japanese to show an attempt to be polite.


 Egypt and Africa.
 Nepal, Egypt, New Zealand, and back to Indonesia.


 No one in particular. I'm ready for them all.

Ryan is married with one son. He works as a general contractor and is very religious. Ryan enjoys riding motorcycles with his best friend Chuck and herding sheep with his dog Blue. An avid motorcyclist, Ryan once built his own motorcycle, then rode from South Carolina to Texas and back.
Chuck is still single, much to Ryan's dismay. He is also very religious and spends much of his time working with the youth at his church. Chuck is well traveled and speaks fluent Portuguese. His favorite hobbies include riding his motorcycle with Ryan and playing bass guitar.

 Brothers
Brothers for 21 years, Sam and Dan will tell you that their relationship did not truly start until last summer when they both came out and told each other that they were gay.
Growing up Christian in a conservative community, neither one of them felt comfortable enough coming out at an early age but after doing so, they've found a whole new bond with one another and instantly became closer through honesty and trust. Sam and Dan will tell you that being gay is only one of the many aspects of their lives.
Dan describes himself as organized, open-minded and spontaneous and hopes to gain a new sense of appreciation for his life from running the Race with his brother. His hobbies include exercise, volunteering and traveling.
Sam claims to be optimistic and happy-go-lucky and his hobbies include cinema, logic games and anything involving the outdoors. Communication may be the biggest challenge for this Team, as they claim to be polar opposites. From academic interests to how they approach tasks, these brothers are very different in everything they do. Due to his passive mentality, Sam will need to be more vocal to overcome Dan's blunt, assertive personality in order to contribute to the team while on the road.
Sam is pursuing a degree in medicine while Dan has one more year left at William Jewell College to complete his business degree. When asked what former Team they would model their style of play after, Sam points to Nick and Starr because they maintained a positive attitude which carried them to the $1 million prize. Dan identifies with the competitive style of Rob and Amber. Both brothers hope that the Race will take their new found closeness to the next level and help them forge an even stronger bond.[1]

Mark and Char Schroeder are from New Orleans, Louisiana. Mark's two children from a previous marriage, Stassi, 16, and Hunter, 14, round out the well-traveled team.
Mark, 40, is an architect. He enjoys painting, working out and is admittedly arrogant and confident. Mark hopes the Race will teach his family how to rely on each other.
Char, 39, works as a public relations director. Focused and friendly, Char is the family mediator and is forced to step in to resolve family conflicts from time to time.
Stassi is the queen of the family. Outgoing and adventurous, she is entering her senior year of high school.
Her younger brother, Hunter, is entering ninth grade this fall. He describes himself as preppy and hyper. Several of Hunter's teammates complain that he can be lazy at times—a trait not commonly found in the Race.
As they embark on the ultimate family vacation, the ultra-competitive Schroeders are ready for any challenges the Race throws their way.[1]

 I hope my partner is as determined and strong willed as myself, but at the same time has a funny lighthearted side.
 Having a partner who gives up easily when things get tough or has a negative attitude.
 I think the biggest challenge is going to be learning how to work well with one another immediately, going from being complete strangers to relying on one another as we race around the world.
 I have always wanted to visit the Galapagos Islands. Mainly for its unique wildlife and beauty.

 Yoga, beach volleyball, hiking, boating, traveling, basketball, snorkeling, anything active and outdoors!
 I'm most proud that I followed my intuition and moved to the Virgin Islands, leaving behind my nursing career and the life I had created in my hometown of Baltimore. In doing so, I not only established a successful real estate career, allowing me to pursue my love for adventure and travel; but I also gained a sense of confidence that inspires me to pursue all of my goals without fear or hesitation.
 Nothing… Well, maybe the drinking water in certain countries.
 While traveling, I totally get off on throwing myself into situations of uncertainty and figuring it out as I go along. I'm most looking forward to the unknown! I can't wait to find out how I react in crazy stressful situations while simultaneously diving into new and beautiful cultures.
 I hope that my partner is physically strong, smart (preferably a math wiz) and down to earth/humble.
 With a background as a pediatric psych nurse, I have proven capable of handling pretty much any kind of personality. I would find it most difficult to deal with a partner who displays arrogance and negativity. The Amazing Race is an adventure of a lifetime. If I was partnered with someone who didn't truly appreciate this once in a lifetime experience due to his/her ego, I would be super bummed. Positive vibes only!
 One of the greatest assets to any team is effective communication. Because this season is so unique in that we are all strangers, it may be challenging (but imperative) to quickly learn one another's communication styles and preferences. Without good communication, we are toast!
 I have always wanted to visit Southeast Asia- specifically Thailand.
 I hope to experience as many cultures as possible while making lifelong friends along the way.[2]

Her proudest accomplishment came when she toured as a back-up dancer/singer for Luis Miguel. She has lived abroad, is well traveled and feels right at home on the road.
Jennifer works as a legal assistant and stock market researcher. When asked how she and her Teammate are most different, Jennifer claims that she is a bitch, while Shana is simply bitchy. When asked how they are similar, she responds ""we care about what we look like and we're both intellectuals."" She describes herself as competitive, intelligent and determined. Jennifer is also well traveled and is looking forward to hitting the road again.

Shola & Doyin,"
“”Bio[]Despite their incredibly close relationship, identical twins Shola and Doyin haven't really traveled together much, so neither knows exactly what to expect during THE AMAZING RACE.
They decided to team up for the Race partly to put their relationship to the test. Shola adds, ""The idea of being able to travel all over the world, while competing on a worldwide stage for $1 million, and to do it all with my twin brother, is way too enticing for me to pass up."" Going into the Race, both feel that the experience will strengthen their relationship.
Q & A[]
  My best attributes are that I'm normally extremely cool under pressure, and I have very strong interpersonal skills. My major weaknesses are that I don't speak any other languages and I have absolutely ZERO international travel experience, so it could get pretty ugly out there.
  I'm more uptight than Shola is, and that can be viewed as both a strength and a weakness. It helps to get things accomplished in a timely fashion, but it can be annoying for Shola to deal with.
  Doyin can be very impatient and sometimes a little bossy (as much as he's not willing to admit it!). But besides that, his strengths as a teammate far outweigh his weaknesses.
  Shola can be a little too laid back for my tastes, but he is a great leader and for the most part he's usually right in the decisions he makes.

Steve & Dave,"


BioQ & A
Forty-six-year-old Steve is an air traffic controller at the busy Chicago Center in Chicago, Illinois. He is a big fan of THE AMAZING RACE and has always wanted to be on the show. He has traveled quite a bit, especially recently, when he went to Kazakhstan with his wife and adopted his daughter, Olivia, which he describes as the most exciting moment in his life. He is fascinated by different countries and cultures. He loves watching Andy Griffith marathons on TV and eating pepperoni pizza for breakfast. He loves golf, bowling, movies and Chicago sports. He describes himself as ""large, funny and friendly,"" and compares himself to actor John Candy.

Dave is 43 and works with Steve as an air traffic controller. He has been married four times and his children are grown; in fact, he is a grandfather. He loves woodworking and bowling and is a big fan of reality TV. He describes himself as ""funny, outgoing and persevering."" He compares himself to Woody Allen and Cosmo Kramer. He doesn't know any foreign languages, but can swear in Spanish. He is a perfectionist, and that makes it tough to be overweight. His biggest upset was when he and Steve made an operational error together at work, causing two planes to get too close (four miles). They were both decertified and had to go through retraining together. He wants to go on THE AMAZING RACE primarily for the competition and believes he and Steve will do very well.[1]


 I've been to 15 other countries, 43 other states and 2 other planets.
 Limited at best.


 Without a doubt, middle seat, coach, next to a bi-polar divorcee and her colicky kid.
 The most stressful thing about traveling (in this case, anyhow,) is the fear that I have that Steve will follow through on his threat to sit on me if I don't give him a dollar every day.


 Advil. The creaking and popping of my knees you hear is real.
 The stun gun I'll be using to keep Steve away from MY portion of the meager food.


 I didn't want to shovel snow at home.
 Because THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS wasn't hiring.


 Except for the trip to the pokey for solicitation, no.
: Yes, we've traveled together before. It was the best trip to pick up a pepperoni pizza I've ever had.


 We do not want to finish last.
 I worry that Steve and I will have to sleep in the same bed and that he will roll over. I'd become nothing but a greasy spot.


 Sense of humor, tenacity, ability to differentiate regular from diesel.
 Strengths? Who said anything about strengths?


 People skills, fabulous sense of humor. He lends me money and forgets he did it. Weaknesses?
He's a little slower than I am.

 Partner's strengths: Who said anything about strengths? Partner's weaknesses: I'd need far more space than you've provided.


 My wife and 3½-year-old daughter.
 I'll miss my wife and my dog.


 I can count to 10 in five languages and swear at you in 12.
 I can swear at you in Spanish and can count to five in dog.


 Nepal, Greece, Italy and Japan.
 I'm hoping that they run us to my home for a nice dinner, but barring that, Germany would be nice.

Steve & Josh,"


bioQ & A
Forty-seven-year-old Steve is a supervisor at a juvenile detention facility in Santa Barbara. His biggest accomplishment is his 22-year marriage to Karen. He is a big fan of THE AMAZING RACE, and when Karen challenged him to go on the show with Josh, it all became clear: father and son needed this trip together. Plus, according to Steve, Josh is really smart and in great physical shape. Steve went to Los Angeles to talk with Josh about it, and found him camped out on Hollywood Boulevard (he had been there for days) waiting for the newest Star Wars movie to premiere. According to Steve, Josh was ecstatic when he asked him to be his teammate on the Race. Since then, Steve has been training by walking miles with a backpack every day. He likens himself to Andy Griffith on Mayberry RFD. He loves to eat, and wishes he had more willpower not to. He and Josh share a love of comic books, and Josh turned him on to building superhero models. He prides himself on being a good negotiator and on being able to bullshit through anything.""

Josh, 21, is a computer technician and is attending a junior college. His hobbies include skateboarding, music and meeting new people. He describes himself as ""different, free and happy."" When he was younger, Josh raised steers for the Ventura County Fair and won a prize for a bull-calf. He lists this as an accomplishment he is very proud of, along with the fact that he once ate an entire bowl of butter for a dollar and never threw up. Josh is disappointed that until recently, his relationship with his father was so bad that he missed out on a lot. He has a mischievous side and loves to ""stir things up."" He and his dad share a ""messed up sense of humor"" and are both very stubborn, but comfortable with themselves. In terms of differences, Josh says, ""My old man is soooo conservative it often times drives me insane. I am the polar opposite. My liberal ways are a complete 180 degrees from the way my father intended to raise me."" This father/son team should be very interesting to watch make their way around the world![1]


 I have traveled to Tijuana and across the US, but nowhere else.
 I traveled a little in high school, but never did anything really extensive.


 Lack of sleep.
 Traveling is only stressful if you let it be so.


 Loads of socks and underwear and my favorite flannel shirt.
 Clean socks. Gotta watch your feet.


Steve: It is the adventure of a lifetime, an opportunity to reconnect with my son and the cash.
Josh: It's the chance of a lifetime. How many other people get to run around the world with someone they love?


 Most of our travel together has consisted of family trips when Josh was smaller, where he spent the majority of his time asking, ""Are we there yet?"" or spilling juice in the back seat.
 Yeah, it consisted of him driving the family station wagon cross-country and yelling at my brother and I to stop fighting.


 Letting my partner down.
 Being eliminated first.


 I deal well with difficult people and feel common sense is a trait I possess. My weakness is that I can be too direct with others.
 I'm willing to do anything, but sometimes I fail to think things through and end up having to fix a mistake.


 Josh is very intelligent and outgoing, but he has a fearsome temper.
 My dad's a rock. He's steady and he's stable, but at other times he's controlling.


 Other than the rest of my family, probably a regular cup of coffee and my job, which I love.
 Music and Tofutti Cuties.


 Only English.
 English; Dad speaks American.


 Egypt would be awesome and China would be a real plus.
 Japan.


 I think I might do best in Africa or South America.
 The United States.[2]

 Married
This husband and wife team met when Steven went with a date to Linda's house for a party. Linda asked her brother to keep his date occupied while she asked Steven out. They have been together ever since and married for 17 years. They both have children from previous marriages, but treat all of them as their very own.
Linda is nine years older than Steven. She describes herself as smart, hard working and adventurous. Steven loves traveling, making and posting videos online, recycling scrap metal and fishing. He is a Virginia Master Angler. He describes himself as a perfectionist and creative. His one setback is that he suffers from claustrophobia.
Both Linda and Steven are well traveled. The two had a very scary experience traveling through Guatemala where they were robbed of all their money and identification. Luckily they were resourceful enough and found their way back to the states without too much hassle.
Together, they are excited for new experiences that will expand their horizons. They love to compete and are looking forward to sharing this once in a lifetime experience together, while making new friends along the way. Look for the other Teams to completely underestimate these two, but with Linda's analytical mind and Steven's ability to problem solve they could do well.[1]

Susan & Patrick,"
Susan & Patrick are the first mother/son Team in the history of THE AMAZING RACE. Susan is from Hamilton, Ohio and Patrick lives in Hollywood, California. Susan is the Director for Judicial Affairs for Miami University in Ohio and Patrick is a writer. Their primary motivation for participating in this Race is to see the world with each other and have stories to share for the rest of their lives.
Susan has been married to Patrick's father for 34 years and also has a daughter, Elizabeth. She earned her college degree as a ""non-traditional"" student, since she was a mother at the time. She enjoys shopping, gardening and traveling and describes herself as stylish, demanding and prepared.
Patrick says he is extremely close with this family, and they've always been very supportive of him, including when he told them he was gay. However, his mother disagreed with his decision to drop out of college (Miami U) 30 credits shy of his degree. Patrick describes himself as Machiavellian and strategic.
Both are avid fans of the show and watch it religiously. As Susan tells it, ""We want to play! He is the competitive one, and we are the perfect Team!""[1]

 Siblings/Lawyers
If they can manage to work together, this smart and sassy brother/sister duo – both with Harvard Law degrees – might have just what it takes to outsmart the competition and cross the finish line first.
Tammy is a litigator who believes that her ability to keep a cool head under pressure, especially with little or no sleep, will lead to success on the Race. Her biggest pet peeve with her brother is that he's a bit of a control freak. This was never more evident than when they recently traveled with friends to China and Victor mapped out the entire trip down to the minute.
Victor is a partner at his law firm and works as a corporate litigator. He is running the Race to see if he and his sister can co-exist in a hyper-competitive situation without driving each other crazy. Victor thinks that his teammate can be immature and selfish and he's hoping the Race will remedy that.
Victor is confident in his decision making and believes his sister should do what he says as he knows best. Tammy would like to prove to Victor that she's not a baby anymore and that it's time he view her as an equal. Victor is modeling his game play after the cut-throat style of Rob and Amber while Tammy prefers Season 12 winners TK and Rachel's laid back approach.
Both have traveled extensively and are supremely confident in their ability to win the million dollar prize.[1]

 If we finish in the final three, then I will have accomplished what I set out to do. Winning overall would be unbelievable! But if we finish The Race, personally, I will win, for my children, my family and for me. I didn't run the Boston Marathon 12 times to win; I ran to finish the most prestigious marathon in the world.

The pair decided to team up for THE AMAZING RACE because they are business partners. Wil thinks the experience might bring them closer together, but Tara has a slightly different take: ""Our relationship is so screwed up, I don't think it will affect it either way.""[1]

Sarah has an MBA from Wharton and is often the only woman in meetings during her long days working on Wall Street, while Terence sells real estate to pay the bills and satisfies his true passion by coaching runners.
Sarah claims that the biggest difference between the two is that she is lower maintenance and Terence is more emotional. However, she believes they share a competitive spirit and they're smart, energetic, adventurous as well as fearless.
Terence describes himself as witty, sensitive and driven. One of his proudest accomplishments is finishing the last two New York City Marathons in under three hours.
This Team is determined to prove to themselves whether they belong together while on the Race. They hope that being well-traveled, physically fit, and highly competitive will help them win the $1 million. They think their biggest weakness could be the tendency to become too intense, fighting amongst themselves, or their dietary restrictions. Regardless of whether they win or not, this adventure will definitely be a journey that could make or break them.[1]

Currently living in Palm City, Florida, Ian, 50, is a retired police commander and private investigator and Teri, 49, is a homemaker. Both have done quite a bit of traveling over the years and have experienced their share of adventure and frustration on the road. One time in particular, the two were separated while vacationing in Bangkok. As Ian spent the day worrying about his wife's whereabouts, Teri went sightseeing and thoroughly enjoyed herself. Needless to say, Ian was not too happy when they were finally reunited at the end of the day. Says Teri, ""He should have had enough faith in me to know that I could take care of myself!"" On another vacation in Belize, Ian recalls how Teri saved his life. While scuba diving, Ian became disoriented and Teri saved him from ascending too quickly. Thankfully, Teri was right by his side. ""She was totally there when I needed her,"" he says.
As they prepare to take on this latest challenge, Teri and Ian are hoping to set a good example for their two sons, Brandon, age 10 and Seth, age 16, and Ian's son, Eric, age 24, and are looking forward to adventure, competition, fun and winning the million dollar grand prize!

 I feel I have done a fair amount of travel in the past, and have always had a wonderful time.
 I'm well traveled; however, not in a race-type experience. I have been very lucky to be able to travel to many interesting places: Middle East, Orient, Africa, Europe, etc.


 The part of traveling I find most stressful is the plane.
 I guess the transportation part is a bit of a hassle, but if you want to experience different cultures, etc., you have to deal with it.


 I can't determine what is the most important. I can't think of anything to remove to make the load lighter. Therefore no one thing is really most important.
 Dry socks, and underwear for if these items are dry, all else can be dealt with.


 I have watched the first two installments and thought (with family support) that we would be great and have a terrific time!
 The challenge, adventure, and of course, the money!


 Yes, we have been married for 21 years and have done a lot of traveling. We have had a great time seeing the world and sharing great experiences.
 Yes, many times. It's been fun and it's been stressful, but it's always been together, which is and was great.


 The thing I fear the most is being eliminated before the final leg. In other words, not winning!
 There is nothing to fear but losing!


 I bring stability to our Team. I take the time to assess and analyze. I may be a tad tearful, but this is overcome-able.
 Strengths: focus, direction, experience; weaknesses: sometimes attitude, and overcontrolling.


 My teammate brings his astute powers of observation, a keen sense of determination and the ability to always help me do my best.
 She is my rock, but she can really get difficult.


 I will miss my children, Seth and Brandon. I will also miss the rest of my family.
 My three boys.


 English.
 A little Thai and, of course, English.


 Any exciting and exotic place will do.
 Antarctica, to do an ice dive—in a dry suit, of course.


 Countries where they speak and understand English the best.
 Anywhere the adventure takes me; I love adventure travel.[2]
Second place in Season 3 just wasn't good enough for this dynamic duo. Teri and Ian are still the oldest players to ever finish the Amazing Race and they are back to show that they haven't lost a step.
One of the fan favorites from all the seasons of Race, Teri and Ian both have fiery personalities and a determination to win.
Married for 25 years with three kids, they were by far one of the most competitive teams to ever race. Both admit that the biggest similarity between them is that they both always think they are right, which can lead to a good amount of healthy bickering.

Teri describes herself as fun, interesting and adventurous while Ian describes himself as tenacious, adventurous and candid. Both are very active and enjoy biking and traveling. When asked which team they would model their style of play after, both quickly answer, ""Teri and Ian."" They are proud of the way they played and aren't looking to make any changes this time around.[3]

BioQ & A
Tian, 30, is an actress/singer who ""needs to be the center of attention,"" according to her teammate, Jaree. Tian likes to skydive, surf, stunt-drive and jump horses, adding that she's ""fearless, wild and adventurous."" She lived in Paris for six months, has traveled to Switzerland, France, Spain, Colombia, Trinidad, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, St. Tropez and St. Bart's, but speaks no foreign languages. Tian fears sharks and heights, but after having done aerial acrobatics in an L30 Russian Fighter Jet, a fear of heights may not be such an issue. Although these teammates say, ""We like to run our mouths, lay out by the pool and check out hot guys,"" Tian usually doesn't approve of Jaree's choice in men. Jaree has a ""more controlling"" personality, and Tian is free-spirited and ""in it for the adventure.""

Jaree, 33, is a model/actress who spent eight years traveling for work in Europe and the Middle East. A junior college graduate, she speaks no foreign languages and describes herself as the ""outgoing, hyper and adventurous"" type. Jaree enjoys water sports, precision driving, and horseback riding. She enjoys drinking with Tian, and says that their worst experience together was getting kicked out of a bar in Geneva: some guy grabbed Jaree, so she punched him out, breaking his glasses. Jaree fears cockroaches and being lost. According to her teammate, Jaree is ""very controlling.""[1]


 I have had extensive adventures for work and vacation in many countries across the world. Unfortunately, aside from Patagonia, most of them have been in very civilized places with little wildlife and undisturbed nature.
 I have been to very beautiful, exotic and interesting places. I love everything new.


 That fleeting worry of commercial aircraft takeoffs and landings, you never know if pilots have obeyed the 12-hour bottle-to-throttle rule. But if your number's up…
 Getting lost, or being on an airplane for hours.


 I am hopeful that bringing night vision goggles with infrared can help us when flashlights fail.
 My Dum-Dum suckers: it's my sugar fix.


 To see with my own eyes this incredible world that I am unfortunately stuck on for the next 70 years. (I am volunteering for any position if there ever is an AMAZING RACE Galaxy Edition!)
 Change my life, my routine. It will definitely be exciting. A huge adventure!






 I am trying to teach myself to eradicate that and similar words from my mental vocabulary. ""Whatever man can conceive and believe it can achieve"" is an amazing famous thought that I am trying to live by.
 Being eliminated.


 I am not afraid to attempt the crazy stunts, but I am horrible at Math—ugh! Sometimes I act before I think or speak before I think, which can sometimes be good and sometimes annoying or detrimental in a spur-of-the-moment situation.
 The strengths are definitely the stunts. Weakness: Mathematical equations.


 She is a daredevil also, but may fear getting lost, which could cause her to become unduly stressed.
 She's fearless, but her math sucks too.

 Determined, beyond outgoing and witty/sarcastic.
 Dancing, working out/fitness and reading/puzzles.
 Making an NFL Cheerleading team while getting my master's degree.
 Leah Remini. Everyone tells me my sarcastic personality and accent is just like hers. It actually was my sorority nickname.
 Brooke Burke- she's glamorous and also a strong woman. Tiff looks just like her too.
 Truthfully, nothing. I absolutely love to travel and my dream is to travel the world.
 I come from NYC so I am excited to see new cities but most of all learn about different cultures.
 We both can be stubborn at times and have strong personalities. We need to learn to take the back seat sometimes and not always think we are the right ones.
 She can get snippy sometimes if things don't always go her way.
 Italy. My dream is to visit Italy to see my roots and culture. I would like to see the area my family came from.
 We have an extremely close bond and I know that will become even stronger when we face challenges together. This experience will help me learn things about her that I never knew before.

 Oilfield Plant Operator
 As a bulk plant operator, I load bulk chemicals onto trucks that go out to location. Also, with as many crews that we run, I have to forecast on how much chemicals need to be ordered to start and finish a job.
 Happy, funny and outgoing.
 Golf, attending sporting events and road trips.
 The birth of my son and being able to provide for my family.
 Will Ferrell, because he's funny, kind-hearted and loves everyone.
 Owen Wilson, because he's funny and a ladies man.
 Seeing people in other countries who are less fortunate and not being able to help.
 Going to places I have never been before and making new memories with people I love.
 We always believe that neither of us are wrong. Instead of listening to his argument, I just tell him my points. I hope I can be a better listener so I can respond to his points rather than hearing what I want to hear.
 He spends too much time in front of the mirror.
 I would like to go to Australia. It would be amazing to visit the outback and see animals in their natural habitats.
 I have never been overseas. Being able to travel the world and to see new things that I never thought would be possible.

 In the bulk plant my job is to blend various cements for oil rigs in the field. I also have to keep track and maintain any and all cements and additives used in the blending.
 Cute, funny and brave.
 Fishing, golfing and Thunder Basketball.
 The birth of my daughter. A close second is taking 3rd in state in wrestling with a torn ACL.
 Mark Wahlberg - tough and gritty but also hilarious.
 Vince Vaughn – he is a fast talking ladies' man but has a big heart.
 I love traveling for the most part. I'm not a big fan of the ocean. Just something about not knowing what's out there makes me nervous.
 Seeing new cultures, sites and learning about different ways of life.
 Tim and I are both very headstrong and sometimes argue about the simplest things to prove the other wrong. To win we will have to put that aside at times and trust each other.
 His dirty car. When we go to lunch we never take his car because I can't fit in the passenger seat with all the junk.
 I have always wanted to see Rome with all the history and culture it has to offer.
 This is a once in a lifetime chance to see the world and make new friends.

 Golf, writing and music (I play guitar).
 Was drafted by the Washington Nationals to play professional baseball (2002).
 Jimmy Fallon - funny, talented, light hearted and he's not afraid to laugh at himself.
 Mix of Jillian Michaels and Paris Hilton – she's a workout freak, athletic, aggressive, a socialite, likes Chihuahuas, Starbucks and is manipulative.
 Not being able to communicate. Language barriers.
 It makes you smarter, more cultured and getting to experience new places, people, food, etc.
 I would like us to be able to communicate what's best for each other as an ""us."" Sometimes we lose focus on what's best, to simply be right individually.
 Many times she loses perspective, forgets the big picture and becomes obsessed with being right, rather than solving the problem. And she thinks being the loudest makes her right.
 Anywhere that I wouldn't normally think to go or want to go. Maybe see the pyramids, drop into a rainforest or secluded island.

 Being helpless in an environment where I don't speak the language/cleanliness - I'm a total germaphobe.

 Neither one of us actually listens to one another - we both just yell at the same time trying to be right and walk away…nothing ever gets resolved.
 He always has to be right, even when he knows he's wrong. He justifies anything and creates an argument out of anything and everything.

Both of their moms were friends while they were growing up in Huntington Beach, California, yet they had never really spent anytime together until only recently. This fun-loving couple is always laughing and is eager to see if their relationship can stand up to the rigors of the Race.
Rachel owns her own high-style flower shop. She describes herself as bright and ambitious and claims that the biggest difference between she and TK are the lives they've led. He was a collegiate athlete at UC Santa Barbara while she stayed home and bought a business and started working straight out of high school.
TK currently makes his living as a substitute teacher. He describes himself as dedicated, witty and intelligent. TK swam in college and was voted team captain of the swim team. He also held the all-time record in the 200-meter backstroke at UCSB (University of California, Santa Barbara).
This free-spirited Team is looking to share the adventure of a lifetime together and maybe win $1 million prize in the process.[1][2]

 Hospitality account manager & Special education teacher
 Chino, CA

 I think the most important skill is going to be communication in order to win the race. If you guys cannot communicate, you aren't going to make it past the first leg, I think. So I think clear communication is what's going to help anyone to win.
 And making quick decisions.
 And having fun with it! Have fun.
 I don't think that'll win it. That won't win it.
 I'm here for the experience. And by experience, I mean, a million dollars. But I think also having fun with it for sure.
 Definitely communication.

 I'm going to be honest, I'm terrible with names.
 It's different, they're not married or anything. But I love the way the Afghanimals played. Because they played it as a game. They didn't take it too seriously. They didn't take it personally. They played the game the way it's supposed to be played.
 And they were fun to watch! You watch the show, and you were like, ""They're having a good time."" And that's how I want not only experience the race, but that's how I want people to see us. They genuinely enjoy being around each other.
 If there's a way to run the race, it's the way the Afghanimals did it. They played it as a game. They were fair. They were fun. And they didn't take anything too seriously.
 Yeah, agreed. Look at you! [Fist bumps.] That was a great answer.

 I would say the one trait my wife possesses that I do not is her way to keep things in order and keep things on a track of clarity. I'm a little spontaneous sometimes. I see something shiny, and I go that way. [Laughs.] She keeps me grounded.
 I try to, anyway. And I think the trait that Todd has is his extrovertedness. That is something that he has that I don't. And I do wish that I had [it] because that is such an advantage to him. He can walk into a room and just be friends with everyone instantly. This guy can pull more numbers than I can. It's a gift.
 I do! I pull a lot of guys' numbers. I really do. I'll go to the park and I'll have like two or three guys. Just to hang out with, nothing weird. But I have.
 [Laughs.] Yeah, he's not kidding, and I'm not kidding.
 We've been to a lot of strange parties, too, where we show up and we know nobody. And she gets mad at me, but I have a really good time.
 I'm like, ""Where are we?! How are we here?"" And he's like, ""Just go with it, it's fine. It'll be fun.""
 We've been to a arty one time at a stranger's house, and they had a microphone and everyone had to get up on the microphone and talk.
 And of course he was like, ""I'll go first!""
 [Laughs.]
 And I'm like, [Awkwardly taps fake microphone.] ""...Hi."" So I wish I had his ability to just be natural and comfortable with random people.
 Like, I love this.
 He's in heaven right now. [Laughs.]

Toni and Dallas have always been there for each other and will let nothing come between them. They are hoping the Race will provide them with some quality family time they've been missing out on since Dallas has been away at college - and maybe even a million dollars.
As a single mother, Toni sacrificed quite a bit to give Dallas a great childhood. Now Dallas is in college and living on his own.
Dallas can be very persuasive and enjoys getting people to do what he wants. His pet peeve about his Teammate is that she tells very long-winded stories. He describes himself as outgoing, persistent and passionate.
Toni considers herself a leader, but knows that she'll need to lean on her son a bit more by relying on Dallas's strengths rather than telling him what to do. Her biggest accomplishment has been raising her son. She currently works for herself as a corporate accounting consultant.
With Dallas's constant flirting and sarcasm and Toni's laughter and personality, they are sure to be one of the most entertaining Teams on the Race.[1]

BioQ & A
Tramel and Talicia have a close relationship, but like any other siblings, they have disagreements. Originally from Gary, Indiana, Talicia, 29, now resides in Los Angeles and works as an assistant to a sports agent, while Tramel, 22, is a senior at Indiana University. Since they don't see each other everyday, they are excited to be able to spend more time together and compete for $1 million.
This competitive brother and sister Team describe themselves as ""the male/female counterpart of the same person, we are so alike. We like the same things, eat the same food, share the same thoughts and make the same mistakes."" They believe that with Tramel's intuition and Talicia's street smarts they will be able to win.
Since they're seven years apart in age, they have also lived very different lives. Talicia has fought and struggled through everything, while Tramel has coasted through life on his wits and charms. He scored a 1300 on his S.A.T. without any preparation, while she got 1100 and stayed up many long nights studying. Talicia feels that Tramel takes the easy way out of things and hopes that the Race will give her brother a taste of the real world.
Talicia's most valuable item in her backpack is her noise-reducing headsets, which ""will drown out the nonsense of the world,"" while Tramel's is a picture of his family and, of course, his clothes.

Talicia's birth date is November 1 and Tramel's is December 3.[1]


 I've been all over the world. That is, if you consider Mazatlan, Mexico on spring break ""all over the world.""
 Been here, been there, have yet to have been everywhere…


 Knowing there is a possibility of going to jail in a foreign country for breaking a law you didn't know about is pretty stressful. Nobody wants to go to jail outside the states. Believe that.
 The stress.


 That would be a picture of my family. Either that, or my clothes. Have you ever tried to go through customs with no clothes?
 My noise-reducing headphones; that way I can drown out the nonsense of the world.


 THE AMAZING RACE?!?! They told me I was here for SURVIVOR!
 Fun, travel, money…what more could anyone ask?


 As fate would have it, we've never traveled together before. After this, we'll probably understand why.
 No, but we have lived together before, and that was disaster.


 My biggest fear is being eliminated early in the Race, before anyone learns my name.
 Embarrassing or disappointing my mom.


 My biggest strength lies in my ability to think effectively on my feet and work well under pressure. My biggest weakness is this 170-pound pack I…Oh, wait, that's my sister I'm carrying.
 My strengths are: me, me, and me; my weaknesses are: him, him and him.


 Her biggest asset would have to be her keen brilliance to pick me as a partner. Her weakness would probably stem from everything unrelated to her being my sister.
 Please see my answer to the previous question.


 People have beds in their homes? Man, I'm really missing out.
 My yellow Labrador puppy dog, Elbie Welby Pooty Poo (L.B. for short).


 I speak two languages fluently: English and Bad English.
 English, some French, Ebonics (wait, is that a language?).


 I'm hoping to visit some of the white sand nude beaches of Brazil. Well, I guess I don't care about the white sand so much. Or the particular country. Or the fact that it's a beach.
 Space…the final frontier. Seriously, though, I'd love to see historical places like Anne Frank's attic in Amsterdam or the pyramids, or Stonehenge.


 Well, I've actually done a lot to prepare for the USA. Hopefully, we'll end up going there at some point.

Tyler & James have since embraced their sobriety and have a new lease on life, working as models in Los Angeles, California.
Tyler is admittedly the more intense of the two and has a shorter fuse than James. Since he has traveled the world as a model, Tyler is right at home in any foreign location. He considers himself to be athletic and intelligent and enjoys surfing and golfing.
James has also trekked around the globe as a model. He claims that he can handle stressful situations better than Tyler, a skill that will surely be tested from the moment Phil says the word ""go."" He describes himself as artistic and reliable and enjoys painting and photography.
Although their traveling experience certainly gives these charming guys a leg up on the competition, will their fun-loving personalities and big smiles be enough to carry them across the finish line first?[1]

Uchenna & Joyce,"


The Amazing Race 7 The Amazing Race: All-Stars 
Uchenna & Joyce are a married Team from Houston, Texas, who are going through an extremely challenging period in their lives. Both worked for now-bankrupt companies that experienced highly publicized accounting scandals: Uchenna worked for Enron and Joyce worked for WorldCom. Uchenna and Joyce's primary motivation for participating in the Race is to regain some of the closeness they've lost during these trying times.
Uchenna grew up in Los Angeles and now works as an energy broker in Houston. Uchenna and his wife have been through some challenging financial and emotional times as of late. After several failed attempts to get pregnant, they tried in-vitro fertilization, but it was unsuccessful. Uchenna describes himself as competitive and extroverted, and he enjoys basketball, scuba diving and horseback riding.
Joyce was born in Mississippi and raised in San Diego, California. Following her own layoff from WorldCom, Joyce now works in sales in Houston. Joyce and Uchenna desperately want children, and their numerous failed attempts has caused tension within their relationship.

Both are adventurous and ready to compete. Both have hinted that if they won the Race they would use the prize money for additional in-vitro fertilization procedures.[1]
Uchenna and Joyce are one of the most beloved teams from any season of Race. The winners of Season 7, Uchenna and Joyce were relentless and stopped at nothing to win the $1 million prize… including shaving their heads. They have known each other for 16 years and have been married for seven. Both have admitted that the continued inability to start a family has caused a strain on their marriage, but are looking to the Race to get their relationship back on track. This thrill seeking duo will stop at nothing to win the Race as they proved in Season 7, when without hesitation, they shaved their heads for good luck after partaking in the ""Fast Forward"" task. A decision that moved these tough competitors to the front of the pack and no doubt granted them a stroke of luck for the rest of the Race. Uchenna describes himself as competitive, fair and charismatic, while Joyce claims to be caring, determined and sensitive. Will their competitive nature and luck be enough to propel them to another victory this time around?[2]

 I hope my partner is someone with a go-getter, ""we can do anything"" mentality. Being confident and positive while keeping your eye on the goal of winning is absolutely necessary to take this thing all the way to the finish line. Hopefully my partner is someone that has a combination of mental and physical strength and will truly be my equal in this race.
 I will have an extremely hard time with a partner that is negative, rude or lacks common sense. This race requires street smarts, being able think on your feet, and being a chameleon of sorts depending on the challenge at hand. Someone who is rigid will have a difficult time working through the ups and downs on the race. Also, I am hopeful I have a partner who is as strong or stronger than I am. I feel that I trained adequately for the race, but some extra muscle definitely wouldn't hurt.
 Being able to work together and set aside differences will likely be the biggest challenge. Not knowing who I will be with circling the globe is terrifying. But, I feel that I can work with just about any personality type.
 I would LOVE to visit Italy. It's been on the top of my travel wish list for a long time. Thailand or Brazil are close runners-up.
 There are so many things to be gained by running The Amazing Race. This is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity to see the world in an extremely unique way. I cannot wait to check more places off of my travel list. I think The Race will push me to my limits mentally and physically, so I am excited to see exactly what I am capable of.[2]

 Rome! I've always wanted to see such an old city. It ticks me off that I was born in such a young city…our buildings aren't that cool.
 I want to see the world with Ralph. We've known each other for a long time, but not very well.  I know we rushed into this relationship, but I want to see how we work under horrible stress.

 Boyfriend
 Bar Owner
 I own and operate a bar outside of San Antonio.
 I am physically fit and dealing with ""not so sober"" adults gives me considerable patience (or lack of patience) to deal with the sometimes jackass contestants and ""partner.""
 Clever, quick-witted and well-made (props to my mom!)
 Cooking, reading and exercising.
 The Rock
 Audrey Hepburn – she's a timeless beauty and captivating personality.
 Being a father to my daughter.
 Not wanting to come back home.
 Seeing new places, food and taking in other cultures.
 We truly think the same and share the same brain, but we never allow each other to finish talking without both needing to be ""alpha"" so I'd really like for her to understand she's not.
 The disaster that hurricane Vanessa leaves in her path – she's really messy!
 Greece, for their history and culture.
 I hope to test our relationship on different levels of stress and communication planes. I want more than anything to become closer to my partner – and maybe ""get lucky"" in some off the wall locations

Vipul & Arti,"
Vipul & Arti are Race enthusiasts from Windermere, Florida, who also happen to be the first Indian-American Team to ever compete on THE AMAZING RACE. Happily married, the couple met in their teens when Arti would come over to Vipul's house to do Tae Bo with his sister.
Vipul was born in India before moving to Florida. He currently works in sales and claims that the biggest difference between him and his wife is that he is strong-willed while Arti is a pushover. Vipul describes himself as fun, witty and hyper. He admittedly can be overzealous at times.
Arti, a nutritional educator, prides herself on her ability to calm Vipul down when he gets too excited, a skill she will most likely need to call upon during the Race. She considers herself to be adventurous, dependable and fun-loving.
Vipul & Arti are well-traveled and speak several languages. Their primary motivation for competing on THE AMAZING RACE is to see the world with each other and meet new people.[1]

Wanda & Desiree,"
Wanda & Desiree are a mother and daughter Team with a close-knit bond. Both women have a great sense of humor and enjoy shopping, traveling and cooking.
Wanda, a corporate trainer, is married and lives in Smyrna, Georgia. Fluent in Spanish, Wanda has previously lived in New York and Puerto Rico. One of the accomplishments for which Wanda is most proud is earning two college degrees while raising her daughter. More recently, Wanda was able to share in the excitement of watching Desiree graduate from NYU.
Desiree resides in New York City where she works as a writer. Currently in a steady relationship, she describes herself as passionate and artistic. An only child, her biggest pet peeve about her mother is that she tends to be overprotective.
Although they are definitely playing to win, Wanda & Desiree also hope to expand their knowledge of different cultures while seeing the world on THE AMAZING RACE.[1]

Weaver Family,"
The Weaver family hails from Ormond Beach, Florida. Linda, the mother of three, lost her husband and their father almost two years ago in an accident at Daytona International Speedway. Linda's children are Rebecca, 19, Rachel, 16, and the lone man of the team, Rolly, who's 14.
Since her husband's death, Linda, 46, has been forced to play the role of both breadwinner and nurturer. Linda is an elementary school teacher who is hoping her experiences on THE AMAZING RACE will alleviate some of the heartache from the past couple of years.
Rebecca enjoys surfing and horseback riding. Her proudest accomplishment is getting through the turmoil of losing her father without going crazy.
Rachel is a junior in high school who likes four-wheeling and riding horses.
Rolly, the youngest team member, enjoys football and basketball. He admits that he's running the Race for his father.
All three children and their mother have dealt with their loss in their own distinct ways and are looking forward to the experience of traveling and competing together as a family.[1]

 Nederland, Texas
 Public health specialist and dance teacher
 I work at a global health institute within a university on education programs and research projects. I also work as a dance instructor in Los Angeles and direct a competitive dance team.
 Go-getter, realistic, and fierce.
 Dancing, playing board games (and beating James), hiking with our dog Zoey, and watching almost every reality TV show there is, sometimes more than once.
 My relationship with James is something that I'm incredibly proud of. We work so well together and even when we do argue, we are always learning from our mistakes and growing as a couple. James and I have been together for five years and I'm always overwhelmed with joy when I think back on all that we've accomplished together. No matter what life throws at us I know we will always have each other.
 First of all, I'm 6'6"" and flying on airplanes is not the most comfortable thing for my back or knees. If there is a leg of the race that requires us to sleep on a plane and I don't get enough quality sleep, I won't be in good shape! I'm also terrified of taxis. I like being in control when I'm traveling and giving up control to a taxi driver terrifies me.
 I'm incredibly fascinated by all cultures around the world and learning about different ways of life. There are so many things I've never experienced and being able to see new places and cultures with James is something that I'm so excited for. Not many people get this opportunity and I want us to soak up every moment.
 It has always been a dream of mine to go to Ireland and see or stay in a castle. I don't know how I began associating castles with Ireland, but it's something I've wanted to do since I was a little kid!
 Since meeting James in 2014, I've always known that his biggest dream was to run  and to be a part of fulfilling that dream is incredibly humbling. I hope that through this process, I can show James how much I support him in achieving any goal he sets for himself because he has supported me in achieving every goal I have set for myself. He's the best partner and I hope that I can be the best partner for him throughout the entire race.

 Event coordinator and social media manager
 I've been coordinating events and weddings in Los Angeles for the past eleven years in addition to working as a social media manager.
 Passionate, ambitious, outgoing.
 I love hosting game nights with friends (especially any board game that involves strategy), traveling, party planning, musical theatre, hiking with our dog Zoey, watching competition reality shows, and going to the movies!
 Living out my dream of competing on ! When I was 12 years old, I remember watching episode one of the first season and saying to myself ""I'm going to race one day."" Fast forward 19 years and nine casting applications later (including Family Edition and various teammates), I'm gearing up for Season 32 with the love of my life. I couldn't be more proud of my persistence in accomplishing this childhood dream… and I can't wait to hear Phil say the words, ""The world is waiting…""! #SUPERFAN
 Visiting countries that are dangerous for LGBT travelers, losing my passport, or not being in control of my environment (lost taxi drivers or transportation delays).
 The opportunity to step outside of my comfort zone, experience new cultures, and meet new people who challenge my way of thinking.
 I really want to visit Cambodia because it sounds exotic and I would love to explore Angkor Wat, but I've always dreamed of visiting the continent of Africa, whether it be for a safari adventure or volunteering with a wildlife organization!
 In the words of Bill Murray ""if you think someone is the one, travel the world together and if you're still in love, get married at the airport."" I hope throughout the race Will and I are able to gain a deeper understanding of who we are as individuals and as a couple; resulting in a deeper love and appreciation for each other that will accelerate our relationship into the next chapter… marriage!

 I tell short stories for people around the world, thanks to the Internet.
 Daring, confident and blunt/honest.
 Flying airplanes and game nights with friends.
 Marriage to my lovely wife.
 Language barriers and getting ripped off.
 I'm excited to travel with the Race because I know we will be getting to do activities we normally wouldn't think to do on our own. There will be many unique challenges based on the culture we are experiencing, that's what's so fun about the Race.
 Rachel loves to think and take time to make decisions. I think we will have to find a balance with each other's thought processes.
 She is a clean freak and organization police.
 I would love to spend more time in Europe. I've also never been to Southeast Asia so that would be cool.
 I hope my wife and I come out of the race with a stronger marriage. We will obviously have many great memories and laughs to share for the rest of our lives, but we still will have many more ""amazing races"" ahead of us called ""life.""

 Caring, adventurous and funny.
 Traveling, trying new food and hiking.
 I am very proud of being accepted into my master's program for social work.
 What scares me most about traveling is getting lost by myself in an unfamiliar country.
 I am excited to experience new cultures and meet new people.
 He tends to make decisions really fast and I like to think things through so we will have to meet halfway on that when racing.
 He bites his nails.
 I would love to travel to New Zealand. I've heard it's absolutely breathtaking.
 I hope the race brings Zach and me even closer together and we grow stronger as a married couple because of it.

Zev Glassenberg (26); Justin Kanew (30)
 Sherman Oaks, Calif. / Los Angeles
 Unemployed/VP of Production and Development for National Lampoon
 Friends
Zev and Justin's friendship started six years ago when they were working as camp counselors and the two have been very close ever since. Zev has Asperger's Syndrome, but they don't let it affect their relationship. They share friends and interests, and the friendship is as mutually beneficial as any could be.
Zev is an avid sports fan — especially basketball — and he has an intense competitive spirit. He describes himself as funny, modest, and loyal, and is running the Race to prove to himself that he can do anything.
Justin prides himself on his patience and his ability to problem solve. He admits the biggest difference between he and his partner is that Zev is not great in large groups of people — one of the characteristics of Asperger's — while Justin is very easy-going and can assimilate himself into any group.

Outside of the occasional trip to Vegas (where Justin took Zev to lose his virginity), neither has traveled extensively, particularly with one another. Their relationship is spontaneous and unedited and resembles one of brothers more than friends.[1]
